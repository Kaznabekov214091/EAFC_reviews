Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC.

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

→ Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
→ Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
→ Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
→ Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).
→ Controllers not working properly.
→ Game keeps minimising on PC.
→ The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
→ Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.
→ Objectives not counting.
→ Not getting XP when completing objectives.
→ The game freezes on the EA FC logo.
→ Stuck in half-time animation.
→ Game-play stutter.
→ Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.
→ Anti-cheat error message.
→ Media questions still make 0 sense.
→ Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
→ Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
→ Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
→ If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run.

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, what iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?",Posted: 28 September,Not Recommended,76.6 hrs on record,"1,740 people found this review helpful

UPDATED REVIEW:

Please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours I have sunk into it.

I won't be completely critical of the game and I'll give credit to a couple of things, most notably the gameplay. I like the animations and the motion of the players, they are fun to control. I play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great. Players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively (especially against ultimate difficulty) but with practice, you get there. Attacking is satisfying too, I like the different dribbling styles, although R1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered, but even still, I am happy that it's possible to dribble past players in this year's game and score some lovely solo goals.

I play purely offline, as where I am currently located I just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience.

HOWEVER - despite EA releasing updates, not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many MANY others face, which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some, lag and game crashes.

I would not want to know how many of those hours I have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just won't play. Sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily, but upon the next launch, it just doesn't work again. This to me is unacceptable. They are aware of the problem, yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released. The hell I've been through to sort it should never be required to play any game. I paid £80, but I feel like EA owe me a year's salary for the amount of work I've done on their game for them. Crooks.

Stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it. Imagine playing an F1 game, but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself, you've crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused £500 million worth of damage, you'd say 'Forget it' and toss it in the bin. The same goes for football games. You need precision and reactions because timing is important. You can't do that with 3-second stutters intermittently during a match. How can nobody have seen this? I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander.

It was a new era for the franchise, a fresh start, so I allowed myself to believe that things may be different, but it just isn't the case for any of the offline modes. If you think adding cut scenes of players winning the Balon d'Or (where nobody even speaks other than some announcer, which freaks me out) and an open-top bus parade of trophies you've won (which is cool the first time, but it is the same every single time after) then you don't understand why we play football games - WE WANT TO PLAY, NOT SIT THERE AND WATCH SILENT MOVIES. Is this their attempt at making it more immersive? Disaster.

True, some promising ideas were introduced, like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode, but here's the thing - that was bugged when it was released. Imagine working on a new feature, but for it not to work properly. What I mean is, that you can't fire coaches, you'll lock the game and have no chance to back out. I actually hope it doesn't get patched, because it doesn't matter, it tells us what we already know - they don't care.

It's a shame because I think that if they'd just put more effort into it, this could've been a really good game. The foundation is there with the gameplay, and that's the heart of any good football game. But why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more? The amount of work they put into 'create a team' for example, which was just uninspiring, is what I am talking about. Put that work into actually making a comprehensive, immersive career mode. 'Create a team' was fantastic in the F1 game, it works in that circumstance, but for a manager mode on a football game? It isn't what we want.

For those who can't be bothered to read all that: you'll feel just like Mugatu from Zoolander - It really is the same face.",Posted: 14 October,Not Recommended,89.9 hrs on record,"314 people found this review helpful

I can't believe I wasted my hard-earned money on EA FC 24, and I'm utterly disgusted with this so-called ""game."" It's nothing more than a blatant cash grab designed to milk players for every penny they have. EA should be ashamed of themselves for promoting such a toxic and predatory gaming experience.

First and foremost, the pay-to-win mechanics in this game are absolutely absurd. You're practically forced to open your wallet just to have a fighting chance. Want to unlock your favorite players? Get ready to fork over a small fortune because grinding for them is a futile endeavor. The game's loot boxes are nothing short of a digital casino, preying on vulnerable players who are desperate to assemble a decent team.

THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FIFA EVER!
I have bought and owned all fifa releases since 2002 on the day it was released. I have paid a premium to EA every year for the fifa franchise for 21 years straight.
The game is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous. Yes they have made a few improvements like they do every year, but along with those improvements which are minimal like always, the things that are wrong with the game made me feel like i just wasted my money and time. I know there is a crazy amount of fifa fans out there, Please do not waste your money. I understand all the latest squads and transfers and other stuff we look forward to which is always discontinued in the last fifa when the actual transfer window begins. Wait for EA to release an update addressing the issues that are there in the game, if they address the issues at all.

Issues that have nothing to do with the gameplay-
*The display refresh rate settings are locked to 60fps. (On Laptop) (Desktop is Adjustable)
*The game stutters and lags and is absolutely impossible at times. This happens even on menu screens in career mode or any other, when you are not even playing a match.
*Drastic and random FPS Drops every 5-10 seconds.
I have a RTX 3060 laptop with 64GB RAM and a RTX 4090 high-end desktop. Same lag and stuttering on both machines. So definitely the problem is with the Game software itself.
This is what i get after paying a premium to one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry. The game overall feels like it was incomplete in its development but the launch date had to be met. What a shame.

Gameplay Issues:

* The goalkeeper in the game is irrelevant.
* Shooting and finishing is the worst ever.
* Even though the ball control is better and there is an element of ""centre of gravity"" in the movement of the player in control which is nice, i still feel there is so much wrong in the overall movement of the player in control.
* Passing is the worst ever.
* First touch is inconsistent.
There is so much more wrong with the gameplay. And i am hoping that these issues will be addressed with an update. I would be shocked if this is how the game is meant to be.

To All the fifa fans out there. Wait for an update and fixes by EA. The game is not enjoyable and at times unplayable due to stutters and lags. Absolutely not worth a single penny of yours the way it is.",Posted: October 1,Not Recommended,124.5 hrs on record,"181 people found this review helpful

EAFC 24 REVIEW
+ Graphics improvement
+ New gameplay
+ Great UI, But sometimes got UI glitch in FUT cant move / click
+ Dynamic commentator (you can turn off this)
+ Dynamic pre, half and post match cutscene
+ Camera view

- Cursor keep centered in screen after my wireless mouse idle, Cant move menu (Moments, Settings, etc. because of that)
- I dont like EAFC 24 song playlist, FIFA23 better?
- Poor graphics optimization, not ready to release the game?
- Should be cheaper, because no longer use FIFA title name?

ULTIMATE TEAM REVIEW
+ Faster than FIFA23 to choose player in squad
+ Claim all reward for one objective (Not all objective)
+ No longer wasting time playing squad battle, Its quicker than FIFA23
+ Removed loan player in SBC

- Menu with scroll down in the top left corner is bad and hard to see (container too small and need larger / bolder font)
- Hidden red dot button inside Objective page, Hard to see and find completed objective
- Sometimes objective not counted
- No shortcut to go to Squad (down left analog like FIFA23)
- Opponent quit after score the equal goal, not counted as win :(
- Swap side glitch (ex. lead 5-0, then your opponent pause the game and swap the side, you are now losing 0-5, after the endgame you got forever loop post match cutscene, force close this, no worry you still won the game)
- Sometimes force me to disconnect to the main menu and counted as lose (Hack? or Game bug?)
- Women in Ultimate Team is bad idea
- No kits color in scoreboard
- So many SBC requirement error in game / companion (ex: SBC need barca man or women, but marked as invalid if you put barca men in companion or barca women in-game)
- Cant skip stadium/tifo/etc. pack
- Removed rank progress bar in squad battle
- AI ULTIMATE HACK IS BACK, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ YOU EA!!!

COMPANION APPS REVIEW
- Unable to filter chemistry styles by type in transfer
- Unable to manager leagues consumable by league styles in transfer
- Unable to change club name
- Unable to change player shirt number
- Unable to pick some player in evolution, need to do it in game (ex: ferran torres in founders evolution, This item does not meet the eligibility requirements)

Having played FIFA titles competitively and consistently throughout the last 5-6 years, I can safely say without a doubt that this is the most horrific title ever released. This may seem like an overreaction (after all, how bad can a reskinned football game be right?!), and I wish it was, but it isn't in the slightest. I will break this down into some broad sections:

Gameplay:
Where do you start with this. It appears that, for what feels like the third time in a row in FIFA/FC franchises, that the AI is only capable of playing at a high level using high depth, direct passing tactics, that completely negate any form of tactical flexibility or stylistic influence you may wish to have (this may be my FM brain kicking in, but im sure most people dont ALWAYS want to play the same 90 minutes over and over again?). Having been in the elite divisions and consistently finishing FUT champs at around 16-4, I have not seen any variation, besides the starting formation to revert to the standard 4321 meta.

Player Flexibility:
With the new Evolution system being introduced, I, like many fans, were excited to see what layer of tactical flexibility this could offer to teams in ultimate team. Unfortunately, this feature is SEVERELY disappointing. In classic monopolistic style micro-transaction paradise, more 'premium' upgrades are locked behind what seems to be a ridiculously steep paywall (I am of the opinion that paying upwards of £15 for a single player upgrade is quite frankly outrageous). Furthermore, the restrictions are so draconian that only a select crop of players can be eligible. Take the 'Centurions Midfielder' upgrade, with an increased price of 150k coins (don't try to calculate how many games you would need to play) or 2k fifa points. The ONLY usable player in this selection that would be considered meta is Marcos Llorente (shocker!), and any other would be a waste of hard earned currency/ies. Like most years, the availability of exclusive players is so unbelievably high that you would have to wait until AT LEAST post Xmas for any hope of obtaining top level cards (and that is generous, since i'm basing this off of my experience in previous titles, having playing EVERY weekend league with consistent rewards). Would you like to use your favourite footballer, Kylian Mbappe? That is a shame, since you would need a literal mortgage on fifa points to afford just his services (lets not even get into top tier icon prices!!).

Remarkably, even due to the 'new' engine that was blessed to us two years ago on PC versions, the level of AI stupidity is quite frankly remarkable. Positional play is non-existent to be optimistic, and downright outrageous on the other end of the spectrum. Realistically, the only avenue of scoring is (you guessed it) Step 1: Buy fast wingers with playstyle+s that offer more 'pace' than their stats suggest (Chiesa is a good example), to then cut it back on a plate. There is no variation at the top level of the game, as this is the most achievable way of scoring a goal. The lacklustre player movement also extends to goalkeepers, who not only do NOT save shots with their actual hands (more so a forcefield aura around their gloves, magic!), but fail to make basic saving animations, and often find themselves locked into animations that they are unable to get out of. We've all seen Alisson Becker make a howler as he is diving sideways, despite the ball coming straight at him (I guess?).

For what feels like an eternity, EA have been very fast to implement micro transactions into their games without actually considering improving the fundamental gameplay, which in turn would give a more enjoyable experience and thus make people consider spending their hard earned funds on the game. When one of your landmark features in your ultimate team breakdown is the 'Claim All' Button, shouldn't you be looking elsewhere? New packs have been introduced which can set you back a literal weeks shop (if you're not careful). Thankfully there is some pushback in Europe from countries such as Belgium, but more needs to be done to recognise this in built slot machine, which, is also key to note, is listed as a PEGI 3 (ie. EA are perfectly morally ok with the fact that literal children could be gambling money on their game, just to get a virtual card which will be irrelevant in 12 months!!).

It is safe to say that this is the worst football game experience I have endured in a while. My likelihood of buying the next title is, for the first time ever, hit a new ground zero. I would encourage others to perform something similar until actual, effective, and purposeful change has been implemented to allow for tactical flexibility, gameplay consistency, and a fair playing field for all those who wish to play (from casual to professional players).",Posted: October 27,Not Recommended,92.0 hrs on record,38 people found this review helpful 5

I could have theoretically made it work by doing transfers on FIFA 23 until the roster was mainly the same but I decided to just go ahead and update the game so that the work would be done for me and so that I would get to try the new game.

Game is about the same overall, but I think it got some nice updates:
- Training is no longer required (or heavily featured) in career mode. I actually thought it was gone until I saw it as optional before game time. This was a big one for me because otherwise you were grinding for the ""all As"" with terrible players at the beginning of the season instead of playing actual matches.
- The cut the scene were they walk out - I know some people gripe about it, but I like how the intro is now shorter. I was skipping the walk out almost every single time so it overall felt like it was flowing a bit better
- The new traits are actually helpful - The trait that lets you dribble is nice and the trait to get longer lines in free kicks is awesome. The latter is one that I will actively scout for because it so useful and make those free kicks less of a guessing game.
- Looks are actually improved this time - When I upgraded for 22 to 23, the looks were objectively worse for me. In 24, the graphics are a bit nicer without requiring me to upgrade my video card.

Overall, if you have FIFA 23 and you can afford it, go for the upgrade. If the price tag is too steep, you are better off staying on FIFA 23 until they have a massive discount on a few months. If you hated 23, then you will hate FC 24 as it is essentially the same game with a few more bells and whistles.",Posted: October 11,Recommended,94.7 hrs on record,"140 people found this review helpful

I bought this game last week and I'm almost 20 hours in. I'm in a bit of a unique situation as a *very* casual FIFA player. For context, I only recently started getting back into the sport as a spectator after a spell of not caring at all about sports, and as such I decided to buy EAFC 24 so I can play the game in the modern day. For context, the last and only FIFA game I ever had was FIFA 15, so almost 10 years between the editions I bought.

I'm also not your usual FIFA player in that I could not care less about UT. Sure, I'll open it every once in a while, do some objectives, open the reward pack/s and call it a day. But I'm not interested in the competitive play because I'm too ass at the game. If I were to load up a friendly right now I'd get stomped by someone who's played every FIFA since they were born and already has a team of icons and heroes and trailblazers. So, I only play manager and player modes. Mostly player mode, actually. Right now I'm about 4 months into my first year at Reading, with the intention of making the jump to the PL and becoming the world's best CF/CAM in existence.

Of course, this game is buggy. Even as a casual player, I see the bugs that this game has. It's just classic FIFA. I've already seen player models inside each other, incompetent goalkeeping, strange crowd chants for teams that aren't playing, crashes, player images not loading in UT cards, etc. I came into this game expecting this. The bar was low. But, it's been enjoyable. I've been having fun. Player career mode has been particularly fun. I've been on Legendary difficulty and am still able to perform well as an individual. It's not egregiously difficult where I can't score goals or dribble past defenders or make passes, but it's also not insanely easy where I score 4 goals every match and just farm the league. The one thing I really don't like is how the manager favor immediately decides your eligibility for starting 11. I dropped a stinker one game and my manager's favor dropped so much that I was a sub for the next three games despite me being a scoring machine, which doesn't make sense. If Haaland drops a stinker every once in a while and Pep decides to bench him for a month that'd be horrible. But I digress. And no, I don't restart games. I'm not a cheater. If my team loses, then my team loses. If I drop a stinker, then I drop a stinker.

Also, I hate to be that guy, but anyone that's been complaining about the game not running correctly has either never opened the options menu or has a really ♥♥♥♥ computer. I have a gaming laptop, so it's not a potato, but it's also not a full battlestation. The game runs fine at medium settings, hovering around 120 fps. The few times I've played online on FUT have been great and lag-less, which was something I remember very much struggling with on FIFA 15 when I had it.

If you're like me and only buy a FIFA once every few years, I would recommend this game. It has its charm and offers enough to keep you entertained, especially if you don't do UT either. Just make sure to lower your expectations. It's still EA and it's still FIFA. It's not at all perfect. But, it's fun, and that's what matters to me.",Posted: October 23,Recommended,34.7 hrs on record,"57 people found this review helpful

Don't be like me and throw your cash in this dumpster fire and expect something groundbreaking..

My first fifa was 97, been with the series for a while now, thought i'd buy 24 this year because this time it would be different... (new name and sorts). Well you guessed it, nope. Same like it used to be, only worse. Gameplay feels slow, glitching players, defending is hot trash, you can only compete in FUT if you buy a whole team full of high pace players (which are the most expensive ones most of the time). So your forced to put some extra money in if you really want to compete in rivals and champions. Plus if your not playing the meta formation and tactics your getting smacked.

A fun part for me with these kind of games is to build a nice well rounded team, open some packs and hope the rng gods bless me with a good player. EA managed to mess up that part as well because of the women they added. There is nothing more hearth breaking to see ST... PSG.... and to see a women you've never heard of appear instead of Mbappe (We have all seen the youtube videos i guess).

Maybe it's just me and im getting tired of the same formula.",Posted: September 30,Not Recommended,22.8 hrs on record,"105 people found this review helpful

Removal of the FIFA name delivering a half baked game and engine and the most egregious price increase!

This game runs terribly on my AMD RX 7900 XTX, and I'm checking for driver updates every day. We're mainly playing Clubs; when a game starts the frame rate grinds down to 7 FPS for about 20 seconds and I can't even play the game. It'll also do that between cut scene transition to gameplay. It's so poorly optimized for PC. Not to mention how bad the AI is in this game. It's just all atrocious and it's really egregious that they charge $70 for this game.

Obviously this is a new concoction and movement from the move when playing FIFA last season and switching to FC24 now, it's very similar to a new game, it doesn't feel like jumping one season but 2 seasons in the future. The newest third generation interaction from Hypermotion is directly referred to as Volumetric. The movement is indeed close to real players, its implementation in the Frosbite engine is really good to be applied to all real players with different physiques which have their own characteristics for each player's license, right, starting from the physical clothing worn and the physical anatomy of the body which is fairly accurate like this is a game with various dimensions of movement, what we actually feel is the same as when watching a live match on the field, each player character has different characteristics, body weight and height, which mutually influence their abilities, body position according to game tactics and timing. It makes more sense that sometimes we as players have difficulty guessing which direction to defend and which direction to exploit, it's very natural, very fluid, plus this playstyle is more assertive than the previous traits.

But that doesn't compare to the bugs offered to some other random players, on the device I play on the most annoying thing is the low-fps bug in cutscenes which tends to not be able to touch the minimum value of 60fps with the right aligned specs I have, you can imagine how much Nauseatingly, I saw 10-30 fps which was not constant but had massive ups and downs.

In terms of appearance, starting from menus, fonts and commentators, this is indeed EA's biggest leap this year, everything has been refreshed in such a way that the identity of the newest EA FC can be clearly formed that this is truly a game that cannot be separated from dependence on FIFA. But there is one thing that I hate to reduce playing this game for a long time, because you have to know that in EA FC24 there is no cutscene before the match for the cutscene of appointing the line-up, formation, and players when entering the field, lining up, and introduced. It's disgusting that there are no cutscenes like this, even though it's normal for football games, we play to feel the atmosphere firsthand and we pay according to the facilities available, but in fact it's not appropriate. It's really disappointing that EA FC doesn't want to share CUTSCENE LINE-UP or is this intentional to remove it, especially for NextGen users? Bad or rotten, for those of you who accept this major flaw, I can't consider it minor, to be honest.

And having entered TU3 since this review was written, my proud club, Chelsea FC, which has a licensed contract with EA, has not yet received an update on all its jersey kits with a new sponsor officially, even though it was introduced to the public long ago last week.

My honest opinion about the game and just so you know I'm a 41 year old gamer who's been playing his good share of video games on consoles for a while and have recently switched to PC gaming. I know most of the people say it's the same thing every year and yeah, they are right. You are basically buying an update for the teams and their roster every year with a few extra in-game animations. Almost the same thing most of you probably do when buying Call of Duty every year. Now, the most important thing about this. Am i having fun with it? So far YES! Does it work and runs well,smooth on my set up? YES it works perfectly fine with some tweaks of course (no stuttering,screen tearing or frame rate drops) So in the end it's really up to you if you want to buy it and try it (Just make sure your set up can run it please). Besides, You don't have to buy every single Fifa title every year, same thing with Call of Duty. You can always take a break from them every 1 or 2 years and you will see you will have fun the next time you buy those games. It's what i do and i suggest you do the same, otherwise you are gonna end up getting tired and hating on the franchise.",Posted: September 29,Recommended,207.5 hrs on record,52 people found this review helpful 16

Pros from my perspective:
The menu feels much more responsive and faster.
The evolution of players in ultimate team is a great idea.
Removing position changes is great.
Game feels a bit more responsive but that could just be because it’s the first week.
Love the new cameras and how it shows during gameplay the shooting stats and different statistic.

Cons :
Goalkeepers are useless.
Goals from every angle.
Kick off momentum is still there and will always be there.
Ultimate team feels like some sort of Volta now, all those new female players with super ratings , the 1,5 meter female midget outpacing and pushing aside my Van Dijk seems unreal and unrealistic (even for a video game that claims to simulate football). I love this game and will continue playing but its just ridiculous, I don t mind having them introduced but make REALISTIC ratings which will never happen because no one will play them anymore so probably the FIFA community will just have to suck it up. I get that they want to push gender equality, but what’s going to be next?

The crazy thing is that it used to work fine in older version of Fifa years ago!
Also discovered a new bug, in the menu to choose to fire the coach (the coach with expertise in different playing styles) I cannot choose yes or cancel, it is just stuck there, not frozen or crashing, just stuck in the menu where I can highlight the two options and I can choose neither, pressing any button does nothing, I had to force quit the game.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,40.3 hrs on record,"8 people found this review helpful

EA FC 24 - A Game Marred by Glitches and Bugs

I recently had the chance to play the latest release of EA FC 24, and while there are certainly aspects to appreciate in the game, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the numerous glitches and bugs that plague the experience.

The Good:

1. Improved Gameplay: EA FC 24 does bring some improvements in terms of gameplay mechanics, including better ball control and more realistic player movements.

2. Graphics: The game boasts impressive visuals, capturing the essence of football with lifelike player models and stadiums.

3. New Skill Moves: EA Sports has added new skill moves to the game, which adds some variety to your gameplay strategies.

The Bad:

1. Bugs and Glitches: This is where EA FC 24 falters. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches, ranging from minor annoyances to game-breaking issues. ""No Commentary"" bugs, freezing, and crashes are common.

2. Unplayability: Some players have found the game virtually unplayable due to these issues, having to restart it multiple times just to enjoy a session.

In conclusion, EA FC 24 has the potential to be a great football game, but its current state is marred by technical issues that hinder the overall experience. EA Sports should prioritize fixing these bugs to make it the game it has the potential to be. Until then, I would suggest to hold off on purchasing or wait for updates to address these issues.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,162.3 hrs on record,9 people found this review helpful 0

I purchased this game primarily to enjoy the cut scenes and cinematics in career mode, and to occasionally play with friends. My expectations were not even high, yet, disappointingly, the game failed to meet even these. The frequent crashes and lags prevented me from enjoying these basic features. It’s obvious that the game is not well-optimized for PC. I would advise against purchasing it due to its subpar performance.Rubbish.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,1.9 hrs on record,"7 people found this review helpful

The worst game ever in regards to optimization.
Not only am I covering the PC requirements but I shall be able to play at Ultra without any lag.
But still, even when playing with the lowest graph the game still lags and ruins that ruins everything.
The most ridiculous thing is that just after the release it was running smoother than now after updates, patches and so on.
Yes, there was still lag from time to time but when playing with MAX graph, not with MIN as now.
I'm starting to think that EA posted false system requirements to scam people to buy their game or the only thing they do to the game is make it worse with every next patch and update.
There are good things though - the player's motion is great and more realistic than ever. Mechanics-wise the game is the greatest Fifa so far. Totally love the way the players interact and act as a whole.
But it's freakn unplayable with all the lag.
I even thought about upgrading my PC but then I realized that the problem isn't on my side so even if I upgrade this otherwise amazing game will remain unplayable because of the lag.
I feel cheated.",Posted: November 2,Not Recommended,19.0 hrs on record,4 people found this review helpful 0

Indian call centers must envy EA, with the number of people they manage to scam every year. They changed the name, but the crap is the same, not even the smell has changed. There have been slight changes in career mode, some things that I've seen suggested since FIFA 16 or 17, but since copying the game code from the previous year can't be too difficult, the EA staff doesn't seem to spend much time on the internet, and they don't seem to read the community's suggestions. The handicap is disgusting this year, one of the worst atrocities I've seen in terms of handicap. Both in online and single-player modes, it's an assault on anyone's mental health. They must have some contract with gamepad and monitor manufacturers, almost certainly.

Honestly, I only bought this absolute garbage because I had extra money in my account from CSGO drops, otherwise, don't waste even 30€ on this trash. 70€ for this is ridiculous lmao
I can't wait for a game that's worthy competition for this garbage.",Posted: November 1,Not Recommended,201.1 hrs on record,5 people found this review helpful 0

All you need to know about the game:

1. All packs will contain 70% of noname woman players. And all of them are stronger, faster than males.
2. If game will decide that you have to lose - you will. Players with 90+ pace can´t do nothing against 82
3. Worst defence system that I´ve seen in Fifa. All your goals that you will get to your net it´s just run forward througt your defence and nobody can´t stop anybody, no matter which defence you have or scheme or tactic
4. Gandicaps
5. Plus comparing with Fifa 23 is optimization and graphics - now pitch doesn´s look like texture from Fifa 08.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,97.2 hrs on record,"12 people found this review helpful

Great game, EA still need to fix the random menu bug when suddenly cant scroll around other playmodes / anything forces us to restart the game otherwise it won't work. It's playable, i'm not getting any lags, in my opinion its more stable than last year's FIFA. Anticheat is working normally now, Not crashing, not freezing.

The only issue for me is, when i launch the game directly from Steam, It can't connect to the EA servers. Need to launch it from the EA Application. not much of a big deal tbh so i wouldn't say it as a problem.",Posted: September 29,Recommended,153.9 hrs on record,"8 people found this review helpful

FOR PC PLAYERS IT IS LITERALLY HELL FOR FPS WITH ACTUAL GAMING PCS. I WAITED FOR THE FIRST PC UPDATE AND THE STABILITY INCREASED BY 5 PERCENT MAX. THE CUTSCENES (CORNERS, CELEBRATIONS, FREEKICKS, ETC) FREEZE YOUR GAME FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AT A TIME WHILE YOUR OPPONENT CONTINUES TO PLAY. THE ONLY THING THAT IMPROVED IS THE FULL CRASHING AND SCREEN TEARING. FPS IS UNSTABLE IN EVERY MODE EVEN IN THE DAMN DEFAULT HOMEPAGE WITH KERR ITS LAGGING. KEEP IN MIND THIS ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED BEFORE THE UPDATE AND STILL OCCURS AFTER THE UPDATE. KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO PAID EXTRA TO PLAY EARLY.

Playing this game after paying $70 for it, I honestly feel robbed. When I first got on, I wasn't even able to play with my friends on Xbox due to an ""update"" causing the crossplay feature to break. Once that got fixed, we would get errors nearly every time we'd queue up for a match. We'd have to leave and rejoin the lobby every single time, and hope that it would happen to actually put us in a match. The menus are also atrocious - it seems like EA tried to design them in the most confusing way possible. It is extremely annoying how you have to enter a 10-15 second loading screen between each section of the menu. If you want to adjust simple settings, like video brightness or audio volume, you have to back out all the way to the main menu screen to do it. During halftime within games, you have to press THREE BUTTONS to skip the cutscene, with a delay between each button. I genuinely don't understand why it would be necessary to press so many buttons to perform ONE action.

The gameplay feels really bad too. There were so many games were we needlessly lost the ball/got scored on because of server lag. The bots that are placed on your team are pretty much braindead, passing the ball to the enemy team at every opportunity. It is extremely frustrating to make impressive, difficult plays, only for it all to be ruined by a bot giving the ball away. Also, if you don't have the right stats, your character will pretty much lose every game. They will not win duels, make goals, or even pass the ball correctly if you don't have the perfect characteristics. What's the point of all the customization if only one setup will work well? I don't feel any sort of satisfaction from this game whatsoever. It is so poorly designed that trying to invest time to improve would just be a waste.",Posted: October 5,Not Recommended,15.2 hrs on record,5 people found this review helpful 1

FIFA 23 was a step in the right direction. FC 24 feels like 2 steps backwards from that. FUT PC transfer market is still separated from consoles, meaning there's barely anything to buy on PC. Mouse keeps being automatically locked in the middle while idle, resulting in controllers/joysticks not working in some menus. They removed players cutscenes walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game, etc. There's a lot of problems I could list, but it's not worth my time.
BTW about the Women in FUT drama: women mixed with men sounds like it'll be a fun alternative for people tired of the same, however I see why it's considered by many as 'Forced Diversity': if it was difficult to pack your favorite players before, now imagine in FC24 where there'll be a lot of extra WSL players in FUT packs. Personally I don't care but it could be easily fixed if devs separated women & men packs, so you get 10x 83+ with only women or only men, depending of what you choose. But of course they won't do it because they want people failing to pack their favorite players, more packs being opened = more money spent by players = more money for them.
Oh and they've said they will close FIFA 21 servers in November 2023, so maybe they will close FC 24 servers on November 2026 ? And every year, around September, they purposefully take out the specials cards from the 10x 85+ packs, basically only giving you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gold players at the end of the lifespan of FUT so you buy the next game instead. That's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move by them and I think more people should be aware of their scummy tactics.
Anyways, I'll keep playing FIFA 23.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,6.2 hrs on record,7 people found this review helpful 0

I play FIFA since 90s until 2013, I decided to get back.
I have fc 24 in both PS5 and PC.
PS5 has so much love from EA, no crash, no bugs 'played Player career mod and UT' PS tournaments ..etc . on PC omg Crashes, if you used mouse or keyboard when launching the game you won't be able to use controller you need to restart, going to market to buy a player or changing formation in mid game sometimes you can't go back and you end up altF4 and losing the match.
*Also no cross-progression.
PC pros : Faster loading time, fps and video quality.
for me game is fun and probably gonna play on both pc in my room and on ps5 in living room.
If you have console buy it there. if not wait for 2 months as always game will be on sale.
Until EA decide to give PC players some love I will recommend it.",Posted: October 8,Not Recommended,36.3 hrs on record,3 people found this review helpful 0

I have a higher chance of surviving a shotgun to the head than beating legendary AI buffs and nerfs to your players

update
the game makes your players play like bronze players even if you have a full 99 team, not to mention the ♥♥♥♥ passing and ai uses team press with unlimited stamina making keeping possession just a nightmare the game is a joke if you just want to play career mode. not to mention with a 4090 13th gen cpu the game stutters and lags especially when your running towards the opponents half or they are in your box. dont know if the game just runs ♥♥♥♥ or the game is actively trying to make you lose. all in all hope ea burns to the ground",Posted: October 7,Not Recommended,77.4 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

Every corner, every free kick, every goal celebration is laggy and drops by like 100 fps. I have high end pc and still can't play this game without it dropping frames, being laggy, get stuck on eafc logo. So many times i have launched this game and it didn't even recognize that i have controller connected via bluetooth.
Gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ as well:
- R1 or RB dribbling is the most op thing EA have made in the last 5 fifas. You just can't defend it no matter how good you are. There is nothing you can do if player with dribbling playstyle holds R1 or RB and comes at you
- If you face equal team you can win fairly, if you face common golds you can have 17 shots on target, while your enemy has 1 and you still will lose 0:1.
- Every time you get corner, goal celebration, free kick expect your fps to drop by ~100 frames.
- Your GK turns into prime Loris Karius everytime you have a lead in champions game.
- A 5,2ft 60 phy female will body your Van dijk in every corner.
- A 50 pace defender will catch your 93 paced Nunez without breaking a sweat, unless you run down the wing then even a 91 paced defender(Balde) can't catch a 50 paced female.
- Roflo is better than Mbappe, Dembele (make it make sense EA.)
- 80% of corners is a guaranteed goal.
- If you don't play with with 2 cdms on stay back while attacking you will lose 5:0 no matter how good you are.
- Apparently Van Dijk and Araujo can't stop and body a female named Rodman ( i see what you did there EA)
- Some of the playstyles is super OP and you can't do anything to counter them.

Overall this game is one of the worst ea football games in a long time. They somehow made a game that seems super realistic and super unrealistic at the same time. Not worth the 60 euros, wait for sale if you want to enjoy clubs or career.

This is quiet frankly (as much as I hate to say this) a horrible game. For someone to spend $100+ on this game in the world we currently live in for it to only work when it wants to is daylight robbery. Whether I play Career mode Manager or Player, Ultimate Team or even just a Kick Off game I cannot leave the game once finished, I have to exit the game completely then enter it again. My controller which works perfectly fine on games like NBA2k, NHL, UFC etc but turns to absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ when playing this. Barely able to do simple tasks like moving through the menus without skipping every 2nd option. Mixing this with all the bugs that haven't been fixed in Fifa 23 that continued in this I strongly suggest to not buy this game for at least 12 months till at least half of these are fixed... you're wishing for a miracle for them to do it all in one patch. The only way for myself to play this game with a smile on my face is for me to buy a New Gen console $800+ and a completely new game that's another $100+... So i'll be waiting for EA to reimburse me with my money I have spent to go towards the $900+ I need to play the game or any future FC titles in the future... Like many PC players we are furious with how this game has started. Utterly disappointed yet again. Nice of you to bring Women's Leagues and players into Ultimate Team it's greatly appreciated for Women's Football Fans but fix your game.",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,88.3 hrs on record,3 people found this review helpful 1

As someone who has played this franchise from the beginning, EA made this game unplayable on multiplayer and it is absolutely broken. You can see how players exploit running around defenders with speedy players. That is the name of the game. It is not a soccer simulation at all.

Excellent game. Great controls. The ultimate team mode is very fun. Ultimate team does have pay to win elements, but you can also play it casually. If the pay to win bothers you, there is also seasons mode in which you can play a team against other players online, and the game will track your progress. There are several other game modes as well : manager, club mode, and volta. Volta is interesting and I admit that I have not tried it yet. It is a street football mode in which you control one player online, and it tracks your progress. I am really excited to jump in that when I have the time.


They have added women into the game in several game modes. I think this is wonderful! You can play the most popular game mode, ultimate team, and have both male and female players on the same team. I LOVE IT! Women can now feel included, and that is what we all want right? This is a wonderful thing! I hear EA is doing that with other sports as well and that motivates me to try out those games. It isn't fully integrated yet. You can not play women's teams in managers mode.

This is my first ever review of a game, having played the Fifa franchise since 2004.

I play on PC, and have clocked almost 70 hours since the launch of EAFC. Now, all of a sudden, I'm unable to access EAFC Online or Ultimate Team. I have no internet connection issues, have uninstalled and reinstalled the game (as well as the EA App and the Anticheat), yet I am still unable to access the game.

There is also a 52 page long thread on the EA Help website showing others who have had the same problem, and have done so since launch. What I think is most bewildering is that it's a 52 page long thread, and there is not one response from EA's support team to help rectify the issue.

How about we finish developing a game before releasing it EA. So many bugs, frame rate drops by half every cut-scene or close up, members of the crowd are just grey dancing blobs, cameramen on the side are at least rainbow dancing blobs. Try to release a coach and it bugs out forcing you to restart.

In short, things haven't changed since 2006, if you want to score a goal, just go to the sidelines.The whole game is planned. you can attack as much as you want if the game decided that you gonna lose, that's how it will be, not to mention the reality within the first half, 7 goals is given.

So I tried this piece of hot garbage with EA Play as to not waste 70 bucks.

- Commentary doesn't work, there's no audio and no ability to change commentary language (not even through the game's properties on Steam)

- Game runs extremely bad, even with framerate limit. The cutscenes are always very jittery.

- Camera settings are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful

To be very honest, this is a 98% re-release of Fifa 23 - as usual. Don't buy.

Since fifa 15 you have destroyed every good aspect of the game every year. Why remove the defence system in fifa 15? which actually made the difference between good and bad players. You literally cant play tiki taka and players cant run through the last defence. A playthrough pass is rediculously bad. You are literally encouraging people to dribble with how the game works instead of actually play good football. You have developed a better system for gold packs than the actual game itself.

I have a team I created and Love in Fifa 22 named Wakefield FC. I Loved this team I built so much I decided to skip Fifa 23 to keep going with my created team(it was the most time I've ever committed to a career and wanted to see how far I could take them another years worth of gameplay.) I decide I would let go of the team/game and move on to FC24. After two games I decide to refund it and reinstall fifa 22. $69.99 for a game that feels.... that kinda ♥♥♥♥ while wanting to continue my Wakefield career going another year. I'm coming home Wakefield and I'm going to win a treble, The only checkbox for the team I haven't checked off. Maybe fifa 25 will be my next new fifa.....I doubt it, It'll probably be trash too.

I don't recommend this game.

Worst of its series. Worst football game I've played in YEARS. Never have I seen this amount of bugs in a previous series before. EVER. I took a small break because I had enough of the bugs, and today I started up the game again.

Played FUT Champs.
3rd game in.
I'm leading in the 87th minute.
The guy pauses.
I score a goal...
the game doesn't PAUSE....
Then in the 91st minute after a random pass, the game PAUSES and stays like that for 15 minutes. Counted.

I instantly quit the game and uninstalled it.

The ONLY good thing they've done this year is that they've made Pro Clubs cross-play. That's it. Still not worth it for me with the amount of bugs.

Not to mention the unplayable game itself. The meta this year is the absolute worst - the only way you can score is by running down the wing, into the box, do some mumbo jumbo and pass into the centre - goal most of the time. Everyone does it, and I don't blame them. It works. It's almost November and they haven't bothered to change it, so it looks like it will stay like that for the rest of this year.

It's impossible to actually try and play proper football, I find myself often switching between my full backs because there is no space in the middle. I've tried multiple formations and tactics, and I've seen a lot of really good youtubers talk about this as well. It's literally unplayable - there is no attacking intelligence from the AI.

Also, defending this year sucks. It feels like EA is punishing you for making good tackles.

I was looking forward to Career Mode too.... when my fun was ruined by a bug in the Coaches menu. You can't fire a coach - if you try to do it, a menu you can't close or interact with, will pop up, so you're forced to close the game - meaning you should only hire coaches if you're 100% certain you'll stick with them for the rest of the save.

The game feels passionless. A corporate's product. Lifeless.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
This is by far the worst football game I have ever played...

It is so poorly optimised for PC, there is constant lag, input delay, jitter, stutter, and more. It gets worst at cut scenes and set-pieces(during and after).
The menus are severely delayed, you will press on one section and it wont work so you press on something else, only for the first thing to finally load.

Lets talk about game play.. the meta is all about pace. No matter the occasion, if you run down the wing with someone with 90 pace, nothing can be done. Then run up the touchline, sweaty goal, simple... OR if you mark the sweat, just blast the ball and the keeper lets it in..

The game play might be complexity different if they patch the game and make it playable so you can counter the meta... but this is EA.. they don't care, as long as people are buying points.

Pay to win is alive and well, I got the game on early access and every match since has been against 90 rated squads with the likes of Haaland, Mbappe and all the other OP players.
The struggle for people earning players and playing matches legit is higher than ever.

I would get a refund if I could but unfortunately I redeemed my pre-order bonus making me ineligible for a refund... Yes I am the biggest moron of everyone for pre-ordering an EA game.",Posted: October 3,Not Recommended,335.8 hrs on record,3 people found this review helpful 0

Normally you play a video game in order to have some fun or to relax and unwind. But this is a different game. And every year becomes worse and worse. This version has so many bugs, so many broken mechanics, so many weird things happening all the time, and the most important: it is so unrealistic football simulation that after 1-2 matches (especially when you play Ultimate online) you are gonna lose your joy and your motivation to play again. But it is so addictive and you play again and again with the same results, so you are caught in a vicious circle. :)

after almost 200 hours, and thousands of hours on fifas before it. I can comfortably say that this is the worst fifa game that has ever graced the earth. Everything about the game needs fixing, scripting isnt even hidden anymore and they have gotten just plain lazy. It is quite obvious that this game was rushed, and is an easy cash grab hence the packs in the store from day 1. Onto Pro Clubs, it is quite literally impossible to get around enemy players bots as they have more pace than you even when you have 90+ pace. It is horrible game design and terrible AI.

Players don`t make runs, slow players outrun my fastest players,button delay is worse than ever while I have stable connection and elite controller.The game is rubbish and I`m saying this with a positive W/L record.",Posted: October 28,Not Recommended,33.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Honestly I thought I'd give this game many chances after playing the trial for a bit but I feel like this is the game where I feel like it's barely enjoyable unless you actually spend a lot of money on Ultimate Team for better rewards and packs. I don't feel like this gameplay is even enjoyable either based on how unresponsive the movement can be with HyperMotionV. I'm far from a fan from it and do prefer the previous HyperMotion engine in the previous FIFA games. I occasionally enjoy sports games here from there but this is the first time in a while that I'm going to pass on purchasing this on for the foreseeable future as I feel like EA has taken out the fun from every single possible aspect including the game modes in this one and not even worth sale price if it comes to that.",Posted: October 26,Not Recommended,5.6 hrs on record,3 people found this review helpful 0

After 70+ hours in the game, I cannot say that I recommend this game to anyone, except the ones who bought this just for the sake of updating the squads. The Ultimate Team experience is just annoying this year for some reason, and the Career mode has continued to be boring at most times.

Aside from the customary reports of bugs, glitches, and more that plague the experiences for many, the game just does not feel good to play. Passing, tackling, shooting, all seem to be have been made unnecessarily awkward for most players. Overall, I can give it a 4/10 experience at max. However, if you really wish for an upgrade, I would suggest that you wait for a sale to get this at its deserving price.",Posted: October 18,Not Recommended,133.5 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

This has to be the most frustrating experience I have had so far all the way from Fifa 19 to now. AI is a mess, carreer mode is a big joke, worse than ever. I cannot speak for Ultimate Team as I do not play it.

Everything besides Pro Clubs has been very frustrating and disappointing. This is the first time I regret purchasing the latest edition, and as someone who mainly plays offline, it does tell a lot about how not only we barely got any new features, if we can call them that, we also lost the matchday fottage that made classics so nice to experience. Transfer market is a big joke and the gameplay is beyond explanation, AI is at its worst state ever since I switched to playing Fifa.

Terrible game, do not buy this. I read the rewievs and thought it can not be that bad. It turns out it is. I can not get a refund because I spent too many hours in the game trying to fix it to work, ironically. The game is not optimised for PC at all. Hypermotion techonology causes too many fps drops, cinematics make my game crash and not to mention the massive fps drops when I have to take a corner. Lost so many games on Ultimate team just because the fps drops cause me to lose. I am stuck with it, but you dont have to be!

From 1998 to 2012 i owned every single Fifa and PES Game, man have i spent a lot of good time with these games and have i enjoyed my time with them. When the first ultimate team stuff started happening i stopped buying these games and have not touched any football game for about 10 years. with the switch from fifa to ""fc"" i thought: give it another try"" and oh my god i am missing the words to describe how much of a microtransaction hell this game has become. never mind the fact that the menu navigation is utterly atrocious and takes you ages to start a game. the transfer market being ridiculously bad design, no way to do proper bulk selling apart from doing it with automated pricing which then screws you over, 2 different ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ currencies you have to juggle between opening microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crates out of 2017 and reselling them in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ marketplace in which 90% of players/cards are worth nothing, and only the artificially inflated top player cards - who not only are ""gold"", no they are ""heroes"" or ""legionnaires"" and whatever else ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EA has come up with - are worth an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton which is absolutely unachievable from just playing the game, unless you spent real money. honest to god, the amount of bullshittery in this game is absolutely mind boggling.

i guess the actual gameplay is alright, muscle memory had me pretty comfortably winning even in online after a short while. But the utter frustration from everything that lies between two matches has me uninstalling the game and staying away for another 10 years. ♥♥♥♥ this absolute and utter microstransaction hellscape. i played overwatch, world of warcraft, league of legends and hell, i own about 300€ worth of stellaris DLCs, i genuinely dont mind paying for games but THIS ♥♥♥♥? ♥♥♥♥ no.",Posted: November 1,Not Recommended,3.6 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

EA FC, despite some optimization issues on PC, impressively outperforms FIFA 23 in several aspects. The introduction of Hypermotion technology is a game-changer, enhancing player animations and making the in-game action more lifelike than ever. The improved player movement and responsiveness create a smoother and more immersive gaming experience. While PC optimization may need some work, the overall gameplay experience is a notable improvement. EA FC's superior performance and the enhanced realism brought by Hypermotion undoubtedly make it a promising step forward for the FIFA series, setting a higher bar for future iterations in the franchise.",Posted: November 1,Recommended,111.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

As soon as I stepped onto the pitch I was filled with a desire for something... A drink- a beverage of some sort (btw i live in Ohio) I realized my tummy was rumbling specifically for the Grimace Shake. So I got my level 9 gyatt up and got in the rizzler mobile and made my way to McDonalds on Sigma Street. I order the grimace shale and as i went up to the counter to pay i realized the cashier was Livvy Dunne. This was it! I quickly called my Best Buddy Baby Gronk so he could rizz her up in Ohio for the grimace shake with my level 9 gyatt. He came and they got along quickly and i was happy for him. But days went by without contact from Gronk and i realized by getting him to rizz up Livy Dunne I pulled him far away from me and i had lost my best buddy. Years went by and I gained depression and was drinking more often until... One day on rizzbook i saw the news that filled me up with light and hope "" BABY GRONK HAS BROKEN UP WITH LIVY DUNNE!"" I stumbled to my phone and called Baby Gronk and he was happy to hear from me and being honest tears were shed during the call. Now in present day Im happy and Best Buddys again with Baby Gronk he admits to making the biggest mistake in his life but it doesnt matter anymore to me im happy now and i will be forever more with my level 9 gyatt in Ohio with Baby Gronk with NO MORE RIZZING UP LIVY DUNE.

Game is borderline unplayable. I am disconnected from EA just about every third online game and there are countless glitches that directly interfere with the game play. This company is pathetic and should be burned to the ground. All I ask for is a working game after 24 years of regurgitating the same content every year and selling it as a new product. the bare minimum would be a functioning product but the multi-billion dollar company of EA is too useless to do so.

This is honestly the worst Fifa/EAFC i have ever played. The gameplay is horrendous with may bugs and instability issues.

Gameplay:

-When you tackle, you're lucky to get the ball back, sometimes after 5 tackles
-Red card in the box when you don't even tackle
-Inconsistent shooting mechanics
-Passing where you dont want so build up play is very difficult
-Broken tactics with 71+ press meaning no attacking A.I

Content:

-To stay with the power curve they want you in the store and the store only. Pack weight is atrocious. Dont buy as you will waste your time and money on this franchise, thy're anti player and pro cash.",Posted: October 22,Not Recommended,288.3 hrs on record,"4 people found this review helpful

Usual Bugs and glitches as lots from FIFA has been copied and pasted to this game.

Top Gripes:

The Crowd drums. omg get rid of it, you never hear drums in the prem yet i have bang bang bang for the entire match. headache inducing.

Keepers cant catch?? this is corner kick simulator

AI moving my players into ridiculous positions

Career mode missing simple things, other things limited to various game modes and the match build up is crap

I like the addition of women in UT but Christ the stats are ridiculously inflated. Does the women's game a serious disservice.

Save yourself from playing this godforsaken, absolute and utter dogsh*t of a game.
Billion dollar company EA cannot fix major problems in the game, e,i. the game freezes mid match or after, and you'll have to restart. How stupid and unfair the referees are (unnecessary red cards/ not giving deserved fouls.), and not to mention the hackers that they aren't doing anything to stop,

I often ask myself if I actually should've bought this game, I mean it's just another fifa for god's sake, just with a redesign of the menus and such, and ofc new players. I really like the playstyles, but is this really the only reason to buy them? Again, it's just another fifa with a rebranding, redesign and renaming of some game modes.

The modes aren't even good - nothing new in any of them
Tbf what I would've liked in career mode was that you could train the players to get certain playstyles
There are still the same bugs and the same AI logic as last year
The fun factor is there - aslong you win games (and get red cards in pro clubs with your lads)

Was it worth the 80 units of money in local currency? No.
Did I buy it? Yes.
Did I say that I won't do it? Yes.
Did I do it, even though I said that I won't? Yes.

The stuttering on ultimate team is absolutely atrocious it is unplayable. I followed multiple guides to try and help with the issue but none worked.

The game is basically the same as FIFA 23 in most areas with alot of features stripped down or removed.

The game is riddled with lots of annoying bugs at the time of this review, most of which require a reset to resolve.

Defending now seems impossible/unfair leading to score lines with both teams exceeding 4-5 goals each. The AI difficulty seems to just be the CPU sliders boosted whilst yours are lowered leading to this weird artificial difficulty feeling.

The only positive thing the game has going for it, is the ability to now play pro clubs cross platform and that's about it.",Posted: October 17,Not Recommended,69.1 hrs on record,"1 person found this review helpful

I bought the game to try it out but like other players, the quality looks like an arcade game. Do you remember soccer pro the arcade game? I played that in the pub over 30yrs ago. It literally had two buttons (pass and shoot) and a joystick. FC24 is exactly the same visually, which is very sad, I have played FIFA22, (didn't bother with FIFA23 since there was no difference). But looking at FC24 it has gone backwards in visual content. How is that possible? This was supposed to be revolutionary, but it isn't. The career mode game play is good, that's about it. With PC I could figure out very easily the routine movements or passing options and cut them out, this is a bit more adaptive. But still, for this money, I expect magic. Sadly it isn't there. Makes me wonder if FIFA employed the actual game programmers previously responsible for the game to make them FIFA 26, since these graphics and stuttering and speeding up with lag - it’s so so bad?
Apart from that, it still has that stupid glitch from 2022 where you can’t scroll sometimes and you have to use the mouse then it works.
All the pregame and postgame questions are exactly the same as Fifa22 – what you couldn’t be bothered to make it more realistic? There should be a thousand random questions, we have about 10…
Also, asking how I beat the team again when it is the first game of the season? Or am I going to be out of the relegation zone when I am in the top 4 with 2 games left? Seriously? And it’s the same ♥♥♥♥ now. I played West Ham first time in FC24 and the question is what did I do different from the last game. Er, first game against them. Fix this ♥♥♥♥ please. It was annoying in FIFA22 but this is lazy. Even worse when it doesn’t know sometimes what team I am managing..
And, in manager career mode, when you lock to player, you can’t use the select button to see where your player is (like in player career mode), that makes no sense. AND the goalkeeper, he just randomly kicks the ball anywhere and you always lose the ball and get counter attacked. There should be a way to direct his kicks toward you. But, I have to run back to defence from my position and hope I am in time for a ground pass before he launches it pointlessly forward. Often, he kicks it before I get there. That’s poor.
Overall, the CPU gameplay is much better, less predictable, but otherwise, I see a very lazy FIFA22 game. I didn’t play FIFA23, but seeing this, it’s literally FIFA22 but with worse graphics (FIFA15 was even better – how is that possible?). I don’t get it. Only the interface has changed (bright white and black, wtf?) and penalties/ free kicks/ corners are more detailed.
For me, the CPU gameplay is good, which is what I do mostly, but the rest is just the same and not worth the money.
For this money, considering what everyone was anticipating - it’s a joke to be honest. And I thought FIFA were a corrupt bunch of balloons…",Posted: October 12,Not Recommended,201.1 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

It's the same as the old games.
Match making is terrible. You play a 3 star team you actually like/support? don't worry, we will match you with a 4.5 star team. Every time.
I have never been the best player, but this version is beyond ridiculous with regards to how many goals I concede. Yes, I googled and yes, I switched to advanced defending (which I have to do every single match by the way), but I still spend my time defending by chasing down players running towards my goal. I would acknowledge I need to get better, but for goodness sake it's demoralising when your 75 rated midfielder is getting swarmed by 79-82 rated players from all directions, and then your 78 rated striker bounces off their 85 rated CB like they ran into a brick wall.

This game is worse than FIFA 23. There are few changes that I do like for example the new UT menus I think they're pretty nice and Squad Battles length being much shorter than it previously was but that is all the good I can say about this game. The negatives severely outweigh the positives. the worst aspect of this game is it feels ridiculously scripted I know the last games have always had this aspect but on this version there will be games where I cannot leave my own half and the opponent is effortlessly gliding into my box and getting into goal scoring chances even though I know I am defending as well as I possibly can but that still doesn't help. I thought FIFA 23 was bad for making me angry, this game has made me the angriest I have ever been in my entire life. I can handle losing if I know it is just a skill issue but this game just feels against my every move. passing on this game is also so bad I am always losing the ball because my player has passed in the complete opposite direction than the actual way I was aiming my sticks. the online is already way too sweaty but the only way to make coins is to play Rivals and Champs which are dreadful to play. I spent most of my time in Squad Battles so I was actually enjoying it until I started to play Rivals and Champs and those modes are why I am even writing this. I was actually looking forward to this game when they showed new changes off prior to reveal but now I just wish I didn't spend my money on this.

a lot of buggs plague the game a few of note are highly annoying, randomly while playing a match u will see ur mouse flash on the screen and make everything move very choppy for a few seconds, cards in ultimate team sometimes don't even display them selves visually at all. there is not an option in game to switch your audio input or output which stops people who have independent mics from headsets from being able to communicate in game. also while utilizing the menu from time to time it will act like your mouse is looking all the way to the right even if your mouse is on a separate monitor and u are using a controller to move through the menus, also one last thing to rant about the refs allow murder to be conducted to you without a foul being called at all. product needs a heavy update to fix issues.",Posted: October 5,Not Recommended,214.1 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Absolutely terrible game, not only is it basically the same thing as it always is but the gameplay is sluggish and the servers are some of the worst out there, constantly being disconnected mid game and then being punished for it. Constant freezing and stuttering mid game as well and lots of crashing too.
Lots of hours later and honsetly nothing gets better, lots of fun when it works but 90% of my ultimate team games end with me being disconnected from the servers and this is the only game ive ever had connection issues with, terrible that they charge so much for a game which has such terrible servers and make it unplayable for the most part.

Worst FIFA Ever
You go to FIFA - you crash on a video clip
You go to Ultimates Team - FIFA crashes

Do you want to come over and play? Use offline mode in EA or VPN and then log in

♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EA client that requires authorization every day, it’s hard to configure data saving.

You set up a defense system, game tactics, a game plan for each player - your defenders stand still and watch the attacker with their eyes. WORST DEFENSE MECHANICS.

Graphics - what is it? FIFA 2015? What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ field, in the menu 30 fps, pixels. Why do I need your animations of bodies and faces during free throws when 95% of the time I look at the field?

The “Fifa doesn’t want you to score” system is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. You lead 3:1, 2 minutes later 3:5.

Women at UT.. Do you know how many aerial serves a woman with a rating of 90 has won? 0. A man defender with a rating of 60 and a woman with a rating of 90 are running - the man will win

You play in UT, you want to leave the match - the Leave match button is simply not pressed, the match ends - it says that you left the match. What the ♥♥♥♥? Then you get thrown out of UT because the workload is heavy. I was just here, what?

I only play Pro Clubs / Volta:
- Keeps getting connection issues while finding game - when I randomly join a game high chance of crash to desktop so no progress for my Pro.
- Many instances when I am lucky to finish a game, it will get stuck after the match so I can't get progress for the game and I am forced to alt+f4.
- It is all to luck whether you will get XP for your Pro in both volta and clubs because it depends whether you will finish the match + be able to get back to the menue in order to get the XP.

EA has been super consistent lately. Consistently bad. Somehow they copy pasted FIFA23 and made it even worse. I can only speak for Ultimate Team as I haven't tried anything else yet, but the game is still broken af.

You may notice gameplay feels super sluggish and slow. Here is a guide to make it somewhat more bearable:

1. Make sure your in game framerate matches your monitor refresh rate. I have a 165Hz monitor and this caused input lag when the game was capped to 60fps.
2. Change display mode to borderless.
3. Frames per second: No limit
4. Dynamic scaling: Disabled

FOR NVIDEA GPUs:
1. Go to NVIDEA Control Panel
2. Go to Manage 3D settings, then Program settings
3. Select EA FC 24
4. Antisotropic filtering: 4x, low latency mode: ultra, multi-frame sampled aa: off, power management mode: prefer maximum performance, texture filtering - anisotropic: on, texture filtering - negative LOD: allow, texture filtering - quality: performance, texture filtering - trilinear: on, threaded optimization: on, vertical sync: fast.

This will by no means fix all the issues, but makes it much more bearable to play. There will still be a noticeable input lag, especially on higher refresh rate monitors.

At the end of the day, the ultimate solution is to just not buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ ""game"".",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,38.3 hrs on record,"1 person found this review helpful

Online play is completely different to offline because of the input lag you get even with 20ms ping. Ultimate team is still shamelessly designed to be get your bank account details. Manager mode is 90% unchanged from 10 years. Actually FIFA 08 had a more comprehensive manager mode. Gameplay still rewards the sweaty meta where you just sprint with the ball with your 99 pace striker and defend with constant pressure 24/7. If you wanna try anything creative in the buildup play, nope we don't do that here.

As an offline-only player that has continued purchasing basically every annual recycled edition of FIFA, I must also concede that this is probably the most substantial set of improvements to manager career mode that I've seen in years. It's not revolutionary, nor is it even as much of an improvement as it SHOULD be, but I'm also really enjoying it. Some notes for other manager career-focused players:
+ The tactical focus (e.g. counter-attack, slow build up, tiki-taka, etc.) and respective coaching staff balancing act is a modest but NET positive change. Not only does it just FEEL better to be able to have an organizing theme guiding a team's playing style, but it also makes it way easier to quickly assess an upcoming opponent's style and try to adjust strategy accordingly. And I like the *idea* of building out a coaching staff, and its current impacts are palpable and displayed clearly, but it definitely still feels more tacked on than truly well-integrated. I hope they expand on this thread a bit more in future iterations.
+ Tactical view for manager career, where you can simulate the game in real-time without directly controlling any of the players. I can't tell you how long and how desperately I've hoped for exactly this. I was glad when they implemented the top-down, circles-as-players sim option a couple iterations ago, but this tactical view is precisely what I've fantasized about!! I can finally get a vivid, fully-realized look at how the team and the tactics play out without my input, and it honestly feels more rewarding to see the team I built win this way than when I'm putting my literal finger on the scales by playing directly
+ Playstyles -- basically the ""traits"" system, evolved -- truly do feel like they meaningfully change a player's AI and capability beyond their raw player ratings, and better yet makes it easier for me to imagine players with distinct personalities and team roles.
+ Hypermotion: I can't believe it, but I genuinely think the animations feel tangibly improved from previous years. Acceleration, jockeying, dribbling, and other movements truly feel more natural and believable. Way moreso than in prior years when they've shoveled the same buzzword bull****
+ Though not really ""new"", I continue to explicitly appreciate the extensive customizability of the interface and difficulty (including user/CPU sliders as well as choosing the level of automated targeting in passing/shooting or player switching)
+ I generally avoid Ultimate Team, but I am very happy they included females in the same player pool. The whole game mode premise is pure fantasy, so why not!
~ The pre-game training session prep. Basically, you can optionally participate in the training sessions available in former games, but this time around it gives temporary playstyle benefits for an upcoming game. I like this in theory, but the lack of flexibility (for example, players are automatically assigned and you can't change which ones are given which benefits) undermine the usefulness. I still use this for big upcoming games, and it feels like a better inclusion of training sessions than in past games' fitness/sharpness balance.
- Basic and longstanding UI frustrations, such as not being able to see players' potential (e.g., ""Showing Great Potential"", etc.) for arbitrary reasons, like when they're on loan, their contract is expiring, or they're a free agent. Or inexplicably not allowing us to see the full scouting profile (including the text-hint for the hidden potential stat) of a player from the transfer shortlist. Like... come on.
- The fact that there is still basically no way to assess players' potential outside of the one-note textual hint mentioned above. Like, it's suddenly apparent if a player has 80 potential or above, but heavens forbid it's at 79 or they've just turn age 22, then suddenly a scout is rendered completely unable to render ANY opinion on how much they might improve. How is this still the only way?? Why can't there be a seemingly more reasonable and realistic ""High growth potential"" phrase or something, and/or a graph of a player's rating change over time??
- The pathetic attempts at player ""personality"", delivered via chat messages that only have like 4 total message options that usually amount to ""Please play me more!"" Either improve it or delete it at this point. It's asinine.
- The morale/fitness/sharpness system in general. It didn't feel like it added anything useful to the game, with unclear impacts on play. I pretty much set it and forget it at maximum energy recovery, and never felt the need to change it
- Some pretty game-breaking bugs, including an unavoidable where the menu interface permanently locks when you try to fire a coach (which you will almost definitely want to do as you get more spending money), requiring a full game exit and restart. I've literally stopped playing for the moment until this gets fixed, and the bug has been explicitly acknowledged by EA for several weeks but still hasn't been patched. Even for EA, that's low.

Overall: Still an abysmal year-over-year improvement from EA in basically all of their sports franchises, but I confess that this is the first EA soccer/football game in a while that has actually felt worth the purchase, for the most part. At least for manager career players!",Posted: October 5,Recommended,71.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

This is frustrating game. Games are meant to be relaxing and fun, but this game offers none of these two to me. First, the contract feature is so redundant in the Ultimate Team mode, but for some reason unknown to me, it has been kept in this new iteration of the title. Worst of all, you have to purchase contracts in order to play games further. I just don't understand why we have to go through all of the trouble to renew players' contracts ONE BY ONE in order to play the game. This feature is certainly not part of the fun. It is just annoying.

Second, the gameplay is still sluggish as it was in its previous iteration, fifa 23. I just don't understand why it cannot return to the way it was in fifa 14, which is the most successful iteration of all of its cohorts. When I play in the matches, I just feel like I am controlling the characters running in the mud! I certainly DON'T RECOMMEND this game to anyone",Posted: October 22,Not Recommended,109.8 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

I don't know why people are complaining about the Crashes happened a few times to me but only ever in menus never in games, on top of that on console the game crashes a whole lot more.

Evolutions are awesome in my opinion really good feature.

Games fell not to fast and not to slow and with the addition of playtyles and playstyle+ makes games feel a little bit more interesting.

To the people who cant defend all i have to say is GET GUD, defending is ez in my opinion i have kno clue why people are moaning about the defending lol.

Last thing i should talk about women, cool feature absolutely love abusing them against people who cant defend and to the people that complain about their rating go cry in a corner you little ♥♥♥♥♥ :)

At first my review was negative, but I haven't played in years and didn't give the game a chance initially. I was already having flashbacks of 2021 on PC. The very first thing I did when I turned on the game was get smoked like 4 games in a row playing co-op with a buddy that wasn't pulling his weight on the pitch.

After playing it for a couple hours, it grew on me. Mechanics are pretty solid, movement is smooth. Cross platform is a huge win. I've always loved Soccer(Futbol), and always will.

*Cross platform working flawlessly now. Finding drop-in club games on the first try. Thank you!

***If you're in pro-mode and trying to do skill challenges, the game freezes upon completion of each one and you have to hard close the game and re-open.

They somehow made something mediocre terrible. They have downgraded every aspect of the game since fifa 23. Even the ""content"" (new players & packs) you would expect something to grind for the first week but you're wrong. The last week of F23 was had better content than this pile of trash. Every goal in UT is black mold garbage where you run down the line cut back and pass the ball to the ST for an easy tap in. Kick offs are still totally broken to the point its the part you're most likely to let in goals in the whole match. So whenever you score you can't even celebrate. The gameplay is also terrible and way worse than F23. They even removed a couple skill moves to top it all of.

Ridiculous pacing with midfielders its like steering a barge when trying to move them around, if theres a AI counterattack good luck all your midfielders will watch them run by and if you have a player close that can intercept then it takes them so long to turn and move that they will be blown past and thats before you consider the ball clipping through your players.

If thats not bad enough this game is somehow using 10gb of vram, capping out and then freezing due to the memory clearing overflowing.

If thats not bad enough this game was marketed at having non league teams which are suddenly removed now at launch.

On the field a lot of players have issues with their hair clipping through so when they run a bald patch appears and disappears constantly.

Some players scanned faces have been removed for no reason.

Goalkeepers take way too long to pick up a ball right in front of them and then their animation starts getting choppy before they throw or kick the ball away.

Well, as always, after purchase game (for PC) you have to dance around to start playing it - go through every possible setting of PC, even though your PC is capable to launch it on highest game settings by far.
After I played it, gotta admit game goes smooth, in some way better then FIFA23. New features added to the game make it better.
But what I absolutely didn't like - cinematic scene been cut out from the game, like the one when players walk on the pitch. Why did EA do this? No players standing and listening to the UCL anthem? Ridiculous. Hope it can be added back in further updates.

Also in the Single player career - I don't get how come you can be sacked out of the team, by not doing one of the tasks you have in a ""contract"" or whatever it is. I played 1 season for Genoa, then moved to AC Milan, and after 1 season I got sacked out, as I didn't score ""4 beautiful goals"" ahahha. (I scored some super cool goals, like bicycle goal, far away goals, and it doesn't count.. And also doesn't matter that overall for that season I scored almost 70 goals in all tournaments, and helped team to win Seria A and UCL - bye bye :D What is this, for real?",Posted: October 3,Not Recommended,153.2 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Honestly, I really like FC 24. Ultimate team does have some issues from what I see, however I don't play it all too much so I don't know those issues first hand. I do however really like manager mode and having the sim matches act like a Football Manager style screen. I know I could just go play Football manager if i wanted, but it's nice to be able to jump in and play as well as monitor the game.

Player career is the same as usual, it's always been fun starting with a low team like say English league 2 and working your way up.

My biggest thing for getting it this year was finally crossplay. My nephew plays on his PS5 and I can play with him on my PC, be it on Ultimate team or pro clubs.

Cant even play the game I paid early access for, ""account is restricted from Online Activities"". Are you kidding me, can I seriously not play ultimate team even after regular release for something that i paid for early access? Do you even have QAs, do everyone a favour and from the money earned from the 3000fp packs, get some quality quality assurance engineers.

It's impressive that EA has managed to find a way to consistently mess up their highest grossing game for AT LEAST 24 YEARS now. The only thing that you're consistent with EA is being terrible and somehow charging premium price for a game that all it seems you change are the kits and the rosters and always seem to forget how online servers work for the first 6 months. Plus for a football game it sure seems like the AI is made by Americans because dear God they have no clue what they're doing and move like parents screaming at their children at a U6 game.

This games is totally unplayable due to some lag or poor implementation. Players take ages to make a pass. Animation makes some unnecessary movements. Opponent tackles and gets the ball of you from the back like you are not there. They can even block a pass from behind.
I'm not an elite player, but could get to tire 2 or 3 quite comfortable. Now it feels like you are playing against the game. And I can't get through tire 7:) If you get a game with good lag - you smash the opponent. When the lag is bad. You suffer.

So many bugs:

> Free Kicks given 40 yards (Literally) from where the foul happens
> Keepers just either amazing or shocking
> Defending is non existent
> Controllers (PC) randomly stop receiving inputs
> Hand balls given when hands behind the players back
> Crowd went 100% white, like literally all the crowd turned into what looked like 10,000 people wearing Morph Suits.

The difficulty curve is insane... Win 6-0 on professional and loose 4-1 on World Class

This game. Is so terrible. First of all, the movement is actual so bad along with the passing, the shooting, the pace, they just replaced traits with playstyles. The pace is basically non existent and the goal keepers literally make no sense to me, they walk out without you even commanding them. A lot of the time they make the craziest saves that it makes me want to tie my keyboard wire around my neck and forfeit the game at that point. Also every other feature is exactly the same as fifa 23 it just feels so much worse, career mode is exactly the same and all the animations are also the same in the game. Even the after match interviews are the same. The only thing I would say is better is the graphics and the ratings makes it feel cool but thats really all it has going for it. But sadly because there is literally no other soccer game to play on the market, I'm left having to play this game which to be honest is not better than fifa 23 and just feels like a watered down copy and paste for 70 bucks at that and for the ultimate edition was 90 at the time I bought it. If you want a soccer game I mean I probably won't stop you from buying it, but this game makes gives me such a passionate anger every time I play it but I can't stop playing it, because theres nothing else to play.

Playing for the Ultimate Team.
The addition of Women players is massive, makes more variety which will only expand as each promotion drops. Evolution is interesting which also creates more diversity in teams as you can upgrade any player you like not just meta players (more to come).
New playstyles makes pace not as important but still important, new position change makes drafts and normal games more convenient.
Playstyles makes players more unique unlike last year where players felt generic when they had the same stats.
Haven't had the first week of futchamps but its been decent. Pay 2 win will never go away but gettin a decent team is achievable at the start.
Gameplay is slightly different, crossing is more viable, 5back and 3 back is now banned in competitive play so there should be less rats. Cutback is still too common though. The finishing is also of more variety with new animations, finesse is more effective inside the box, and shooting playstyles will be sought for (chipping, trivela, power shot).

Pro Clubs solo on pc is not working at the moment but this year it is Cross-platform so worth getting once patched.",Posted: October 5,Recommended,176.1 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Once again, EA Sports has managed to fall flat on their face and release a game that only occasionally works as it's supposed to. Outside of their support for their ""let children gamble so we can take their parents' money"" mode, it seems like fixes are few and far between - and god forbid this works on release (for a $70 game). If you want a game that you can actually play with regularity, I'd keep an eye out for when they actually fix 30% of this one, or just buy a different game.",Posted: October 9,Not Recommended,33.9 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Your trial has ended, do you want to revisit your review?

First of all I want to point out I only play career mode and none of the online features.
I really tried to like it. So much so I went to EA Play Pro once my trial was over so I can give it a chance. Spent around 10-15 hours in it and it is over for me.

So what is wrong with it? It's just bad. Very clunky, gameplay is super slow and weird. Defending is non-existent to the point that your defender is running away from the attacker, the AI is so scripted the ball literally goes throw your defenders like they are ghosts and it is just visible the game decides ""oh you are losing this one"". Horrendous. I don't think I should use sliders to compensate for the incompetence of EA to actually make their AI either good or bad, but not just switching from slow and confused to rocket in a second. I play FIFA since 05 and this is by far the worst scripted one. And last but not least, it just feels like an arcade game, no cutscenes at the start of a match? Why? Who thought that career mode players would want that??? Anyways, this is the first time I am actually downloading the previous game so I can atleast play some football. I can honestly say at this state FC24 is by far the worst product EA could've come up with.

Posting my original review, so people can see I actually wanted to give it a chance:
Don't mind the very small time I spent in the game, unlike many others my game runs fine and it boots without any issues.
Also know I only play offline/career mode so I cannot speak of how the game performs online.

Like FIFA23 I keep getting my SSD randomly spiking to 100%, making the game pretty much unplayable. It used to do it like twice a match, which was fine but now it does it like 10 times a match, sometimes it freezes multiple times in the span of one minute. I see EA ""support"" says we should check our disks for issues, but every other game I play goes fine and never does that. My PC is not high-end and besides those super annoying freezes it is quite enjoyable and different.",Posted: October 9,Not Recommended,9.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Afwul. Cash grab. That's all there is to this.

How can a company that earns that much, be this bad at actually coding a game to run well. Here is a couple of quick reasons why not to buy this game:
- There is A LOT of button delay when playing online. Passes will often take off a full 1.5-2 seconds after you've given the button imput.
- There is a clear and obvious cheating problem that, even after 5 YEARS of me playing this game on this platform, still has not been addressed.
- It is complete RNG whether or not you'll win an online match. It's almost as if the servers actively try to give you or your opponent an edge through 'passing errors' that the AI make.

There is nothing enjoyable about this game anymore. I for sure will not buy this game again, and I advise you not to either.",Posted: November 5,Not Recommended,15.7 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

Obviously it's better than FIFA23.
They changed graphics a bit, added new cutscenes, new movement (cosmetics for me), several good functions both on player (like agent for example or pre-match training) and manager career (improved tactics, no training system). As long as I played, I'm happy with the changes made. However I haven't encountered any game-breaking bug yet, but I saw some coding problems and that's all. I like the product, but it's too overpriced. Many things are the same, so why do we have to pay more for getting small updates? Especially there's no longer FIFA licence, so they don't have to pay 150 milions for it (according to the Internet).



The game still lacks Polish commentary, the first update made it getting random fps drops while playing, despite the fact I got enough resources to play it at least on recommended requirements. I'll watch the game carefully as it seems to be a gem if we consider the previous version (s). I think, the game will be worth it if they fix the fps drops. Even people with NASA PCs complain about random fps drops while playing.",Posted: September 29,Recommended,9.8 hrs on record,4 people found this review helpful 0

I'll start by saying that i've only played Ulimate Team game mode and in my opinion they've totally RUINED it.
I'm not saying that bringing female cards to it is a bad thing but it totally fu*ks up the market and prices.
There's no more building your squad from the ground up (this was the case before also if you paid for fifa points).
I've played like 10 games and my team OVR is 86 as it was 91 in the end of FIFA 23. That shouldn't be possible in my opinion and it ruins the experience.

The gameplay itself is clunky and feels non responsive. Graphics aren't any better than in the last years release. I wasn't expecting huge changes but gameplay wise i think this is a step backwards. Goalkeepers are useless, they basically dodge shots. :D

It's not all bad though. I like the shortcuts they made for ultimate team so you can quickly go from sbc -> market etc.
Haven't tried yet but i believe that the manager mode is better than ever before but i mostly play (F)UT online.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND to buy this for full price. Before it was an advantage in FUT to start at launch but you get a good team instantly now so it doesnt hurt to wait for this to get a discount.

BTW menu music is AWFUL i had to mute it.

If i could i would refund this and skip the whole game this year but because i opened one pack in early access they wouldnt let me to refund the game.

""EA Sports FC 24"" truly sets a new standard when it comes to graphics and presentation in the world of football gaming. The visual elements are incredibly impressive, and they manage to create an unparalleled sense of realism and immersion. You genuinely feel like you're part of a real football league, thanks to the meticulous attention to detail in player animations and stadium design.

However, speaking from a personal standpoint, the gameplay can be a bit of a mixed bag. The momentum/scripting system, while intriguing, sometimes feels capricious. It can be challenging to anticipate outcomes, and that unpredictability can occasionally be a source of frustration because you suddenly lose control of your player.

For example, in a match, if one team is significantly better than the other, the scripting mechanic may come into play to level the playing field. This could lead to the underdog team suddenly performing exceptionally well, while the stronger team might experience a dip in performance. In essence, it's an attempt to make games more exciting and less one-sided.

In conclusion, ""EA Sports FC 24"" offers an awe-inspiring visual experience for football enthusiasts. The game's attention to detail is truly commendable. On the flip side, the gameplay has not changed much from the last decade, particularly the impact of the momentum system, can be a bit perplexing at times, making the overall experience a bit of a rollercoaster.",Posted: October 26,Not Recommended,0.1 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

I really need to cut this addiction. I would really like the arrival of a competitor at FC24 to have a real game that we don't complain about every year. How can you get screwed every year on a game that has bugs during the first 3-4 months with shaky gameplay?

Pathetic attempt from EA.

Commentary doesn't work.
Teams lining up before a match removed.
Invisible players.
Fuzzy graphics during certain replays.
Game freezes when trying to fire a coach, turning one of the few new features into a game breaking bug.
Women having better stats than Messi.

Stick to roster updates EA. I'll wait for FM.",Posted: October 7,Not Recommended,9.8 hrs on record,"1 person found this review helpful

I have 42 hours of playtime... That means that I have played for 2 full days of the seven total days the game has been out, so my opinion is very much so justified.

EA Sports, you make the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ game every year.

Your whole schpeel this year was that it was ""the worlds game"", yet I cannot even connect to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ world, as my account (as well as thousands of others) is ""restricted from online features"". This would be fine, as I usually mainly play offline modes, but the game is now officially released, and I still cannot access online!

Not to mention that cutscenes going from gameplay to a corner, freekick, goalkick, penalty are all freeze simulators.

All the talk about a new Career mode was a whole lotta nothin, as the changes are very minute this year. If you aren't going to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the offline modes, at least make modding easier!!!

Not sure if it is a trial thing or not but the game is a lot glitchy; players get invisible during the game, stupid directional long through passes (it literally made a long through pass to goalkeeper instead to an attacker), goalkeeper seems to be helpless coming forward on one on one situations every time, and it has gotten a lot easier to goal.

A main feature in this game has been broken since beta phase, which is the Drop In matchmaking in Clubs (Pro Clubs previously...) EA recently acknowledged it, but haven't been exactly very responsive to this issue that's been ongoing for several weeks now. When you pay full price you're supposed to to be able to utilize the base game under workable conditions, not this embarrassment. They've always ignored Pro Clubs issues for many years.

Completely and utterly broken. Do not buy

Blatant match fixing has always been a problem in FIFA games, however its amped up 10x in this game. If you merely press B or Circle to tackle in the box, you will give away a penalty and you will have your defender be sent off. If you don't do this, the opposition score. Every time you do score a goal, the opposition will immediately score and you will not be able to do anything about it. The ball and attacking players will literally phase through your defenders if the game decides it wants you to lose.

As a Newcastle United fan, I obviously play as them a lot. Anthony Gordon, the fastest player in the Premier League is one of the slowest wingers I've ever used in a football game. Sven Botman STILL does not have his face in the game despite being one of the best players at a huge Premier League and Champions League club. Newcastle and Arsenal do not have their European number fonts in the game.

Using a controller is completely broken in this game, just as it was in FIFA 23. Half the time it will work, but the other half you won't even be playing the game. Your players won't move, or will run off in some random direction, completely out of your control. In the menus, you will try to navigate and either nothing will happen or you will flick through all options really fast when you are trying to do something. You literally can't change players when trying to defend. You can't pass or shoot or anything, you will just run off the pitch. You have to then press a button 50 times for it to register what you are doing, by which time the game has moved on.

Please, please, please do not buy the game. All of this is aside from the fact its literally the exact same game as every other year. Don't be as stupid as me, do not buy. Steam NEED to allow refunds for everyone who bought this complete scam of a game",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,80.6 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

I would love to offer a more in-depth review but I've been unable to get the game to go past the splash screen when you first boot it up and have since refunded. Seems to be an incompatibility issue with some of the latest AMD drivers, so not exactly an issue with the game itself. But whilst searching around for potential solutions to that problem, I was sadly seeing plenty of other issues that seemed to be present in the PC version, which led me to go for the refund in the end. Approach the PC version with caution, swing for the console version if you have one and still want to play. Of course, if PC is your only or preferred option, then you will have to make the value assessment on your own terms. I expect the AMD driver issue will be or already has been resolved. The other issues will be for EA to sort.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,0.2 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

This is the least realistic soccer game I have ever played in my life. If you don't care about the stats of the players and the speed of your defenders who are lost with every sprint and overhead ball, if you like how the opponent uses the kick off glitch and you lose a goal every time you resume from the middle, if you like how you win 5:0 and the opponent disconnects from the server and doesn't credit you with the victory, if you like to learn by heart how to use two buttons to attack, go down under the goal withdraw the ball and score this game is for you. If you think referees in real life are terrible it could be worse though. The developers who released this game should be ashamed that something like this saw the light of day and the bought reviews only reflect this perfectly. I think Pet Soccer is more realistic than this year's ""Fifa"".

I can say EA FC 24 is better than all FIFA games. The reason behind that idea is game play is better than all other FIFA's. Also optimization is better than FIFA 23. I don't have any fps drops with my RTX3050 mobile and I'm playing over 120 fps. Before buying this game i had questions on my mind. One of this questions is having women in FUT. Having women players whom has more strength and pace than men sounded awkward and i still think so. But having women in FUT made more playable players in FIFA and at the beginning of the game it really helps constructing teams. The new skills that players have is really OP, For example I have CR7 in my team, and he has a skill which makes him to shoot power shoots faster and accurate. It makes CR7 playable even though he is in Saudi Arabia. If you are interested in buying this game and have questions about optimization or thinking whether game play is different, I can easily tell that optimization is good, and game play is improved. But if you are interested in playing career mode only, it's not necessary to buy. If you're going to play online modes you should definitely buy.",Posted: October 3,Recommended,96.1 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Every time i get the ball our attacker or winger just rolls the ball and lose it. max 5 pass can be done by my teammates. wtf these thing were on fifa 21 and 22 and 23. i hope every pack that u sell to another dumbass player stick ur ass one day.

TBH I kinda like EAFC 24. I went through a lot of negative reviews and I'm not going to ignore the fact its all false Yes, there are few things to keep in mind before buying the game is that the gameplay is almost identical like the FIFA 23, Player models are the same, Runs heavily on micro transactions and has a few optimisation issues but if you love playing FIFA you would absolutely wont care about anything because at the end of the day we love grinding and yes we love playing football.

Words written with capital letters and underscores pop out at some point, Controller input stops recieving orders all of a sudden due to a sudden game freeze that lasts for 1 second and takes 3 seconds to regain control even in offline mode, Defending is manual but even the positioning of the new passive defending AI is horrendous beyond imagination, Menus keep crashing/freezing and not taking any respond from controller/keyboard, We are stuck with coaches in career mode we cant dismiss because the game freezes if we do that, ball with leg collosion sometimes appear non existant at somepoint it goes through the player's legs to the goal, All of this anti-cheat fuzz and hackers still present, Really is like any other year but with every new year technical issues for PC increases because the greedy dev teams that are responsible for solving basic coding blocks and basic scripting texts are rushing work as it is obvious from what i have experienced in the very first 3 matches, On the other hand it has many good features and additions to hypermotion and new career additions, Technical issues and bugs appear way to heavy compared to the positive side, FC 24, It's the first FC like any other FIFA.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,297.8 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 1

Excellent game. Great controls. The ultimate team mode is very fun. Ultimate team does have pay to win elements, but you can also play it casually. If the pay to win bothers you, there is also seasons mode in which you can play a team against other players online, and the game will track your progress. There are several other game modes as well : manager, club mode, and volta. Volta is interesting and I admit that I have not tried it yet. It is a street football mode in which you control one player online, and it tracks your progress. I am really excited to jump in that when I have the time.

I am new to FIFA video games (now just titled FC because of licensing). There is alot to learn! I don't mean rules, I already know those, I enjoy sports. There is a lot to learn in terms of button combinations, plays, positioning, and other game mechanics. I still have much room to grow, but am getting better each play. One downside the game has is the lack of tutorial. The tutorial is in a different game mode and will walk you through gameplay mechanics but it does leave a lot to be desired. Fortunately, if you are committed to getting better there are a ton of resources available online to improve your game.

They have added women into the game in several game modes. I think this is wonderful! You can play the most popular game mode, ultimate team, and have both male and female players on the same team. I LOVE IT! Women can now feel included, and that is what we all want right? This is a wonderful thing! I hear EA is doing that with other sports as well and that motivates me to try out those games. It isn't fully integrated yet. You can not play women's teams in managers mode. I did read an article that hinted it will be in future versions of this game.",Posted: September 29,Recommended,59.8 hrs on record,3 people found this review helpful 1

Game goes into windowed mode randomly after black screening for half a second. Sometimes this leads to the game completely freezing and then it just crashes my whole PC.

EA's approach to FC24 has become predictable, and that's not a good thing. The game performance is adequate, but the lack of innovation is disappointing. It's time for EA to take a hard look at what fans are asking for and deliver something fresh. We're tired of seeing the same features with minimal improvements. It's about time they surprise us with a truly innovative FC24 experience.",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,64.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

EA is a sad company, I genuinely wish somebody else could make these sports games because its not hard to make a good game it just requires effort.

Even before buying it, I had a distant feeling that it was a mistake.

Crashes, lags, same old game but with the new squads. Sometime I wonder, if they would ever dare to update the squads for the prev vision... in that case, I guess the new one won't even stand a chance.

It's just an old game with new graphic design plus squad updates, that's it.

Same old Fifa... oh i mean EA FC all about Ultimate team! Money maker nothing else!

Clubs still doesn't work! Cant 'find a match' even tho there are 15,000 people playing.
Goalkeeper physics...well what physics? Bone crunching tackles are played on.. but if i run into my own player i get a red and the other team gets free kicks/pens.
Its a F**king joke! Sort it out!
Still going to carrying on playing as its an unhealthy addiction.

FINALLY! EA has brought this back to its former glory! Honestly this is the BEST game that they have released since Fifa 12. Well done EA! Truly great game from the physics, playstyle system, pro-clubs, ut, and overall everything. Will finally keep on getting the new games if they keep up this amazing work! However I would like to see them bring relegation in clubs but that is a minor thing. Would definitely recommend this to anyone that has taken a break from Fifa as it truly is a fun game again!",Posted: October 1,Recommended,60.1 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 1

When other people have problems launching and playing games, it almost never happens to me. I see all the negative reviews here, most of them are just the typical ""EA bad"" circlejerk, but some of them actually list real problems. I'll add on to that here with my experience with the game.


[1.] Game took 4 tries to launch in the first place. EA App keeps crashing.
[2.] When game actually does launch, it freezes on the first screen. Had to quit and relaunch again.
[3.] When I got past the first screen, I'm told to pick my club/league/etc. I can't move the thing to make any selections at all. I close and relaunch AGAIN.
[4.] Now my cursor moves! Oh wait, it's only moving in one direction and I can't go the other way at all. Close and relaunch...
[5.] Okay, cursor moves both directions, I can pick my league and whatnot. Now let's go make a player and start career mode! Oh the cursor broke again. Close and do research that shows this was a problem last year too. If you have a mouse and keyboard, which you probably do considering you're on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, it defaults to trying to use them in menus instead of JUST the controller. I tried just unplugging my m+kb to get around this, didn't help me.
[6.] Eventually make my way into making my character, I get him just how I want and get to the main screen. I had to leave the house right after, so I save and quit. When I came back to finally play the game..... my save data was gone. My settings are not saved, I'd have to remake my player again, etc.
[7.] Uninstall and refund because if it deleted my character right at the start, I am NOT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around with losing actual progress down the line.


So there you go. I'm really bummed as I was really looking forward to playing this one, I skipped last year in anticipation of the new game having a new name and was hoping it would be smoother than ever. That is certainly not the case. I wouldn't even bother if you value your time, if it doesn't break immediately, it'll probably break when it will hurt a lot more later down the line.",Posted: September 30,Not Recommended,0.5 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Game is def the best ea ""fifa"" there are some issues but realistically its the most realistic with physics and gameplay than any fifa. IMO most of the complaints people have are a skill gap & them trying to play the same way they played old games. EA is still EA and server sucks sometimes but overall enjoy the game.

I don't normally write reviews for games but honestly i have to say, I LOVE THIS GAME. It been the first fifa since 14 i have grinded and loved the gameplay. Not only have i been playing both single player career mode, manager career mode but i have also been grinding UT. It has been a very enjoyable exp so fair. I Preordered the game and was playing it for 7 days before public release and as you can see im well over 100 hours so far.

The game does has its flaws however

1. The defending is some of the hardest it has ever been
2. Running down the line and passing into the box is stupid OP and there seems to be no way to defend against it.
3. The mains are little laggy and there is a lot of button dely when in the mains themselves.

HOWEVER there are some really good positives to this game as well

1. The battle pass (or level system Objectives) give you a mega load of packs and really good rewards and i have to admit that it takes little to no effort to get up the lvs. You have Bi-weekly objectives where you can get 2000 xp for just playing 30 games in any game mode. You get daily xp as well which = up too 200xp a day. There is now 40 lvs for the battle pass and the rewards are really engaging as i have talked about above.
2. SQUAD BATTLES is now 4 minutes half's meaning that the whole match is 8 minutes long meaning it doesnt take that long to play each match.
3. THE EVOS are amazing, i know that one of them is 50k coins or 1000FC points but i promise getting 50k in this game is super easy as moment rewards are Tradable and so you can earn enough coins.
4. The playstyles and Playstyles + make are amazing and really make the game more fun as you start to prio them for each player meaning that you can really make some amazing teams. Picking each player that fits your playstyle.

I really am looking forward to what this game turns into over the course of the year but so far it has been extremely enjoyable. I really hope the Battle pass is just as enjoyable now when we get season 2 and the SBC's continue to being priced good and match the power curve of the game.

I would give this game 7/10 SO FAR",Posted: October 4,Recommended,320.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

To the developers of EAFC 24, PLEASE MAKE DEFENDING EASIER. You can accomplish this in two ways. First of all, reduce the computers attacking capability. They always do these broken kick the ball 10 yards ahead and then sprint to the ball, completely burning your defenders. It is also nearly impossible to win the ball back when the computer has possession. Tackling is really hard. In my past 10 games, I have conceded 1 goal in two of them, 2 goals in one of them, 3 goals in four of them, and 4 goals in three of them. On the other side, out of my past 10 games, I have won 9 and drawn 1 on world class difficulty. I hate having all of these high scoring games because it is so unrealistic and extremely frustrating defensively. Please fix your coding to reduce the computers attacking capabilities and increase the users defending capability, especially the user's computer. The defenders that you are not controlling on your team will literally let the computers attacker run through them. It is like they have a pact between each other. I have 2 more comments. 1, I have still not figured out how to move your goalkeeper on penalty kicks. I tried searching online and looking at the controls in the game, but no matter what buttons I smash, the goalkeeper does not move. He just stands still and does a standing dive like 2 feet to his left or right. Lastly, if the computer has a free kick within 5 yards of the penalty box, it is a 100% guaranteed goal. What is even more frustrating is I can see my goalkeeper holding a horrible position for the free kicks, but I can't do anything to change it. Also they haven't fixed near post goalkeeping. My goalkeeper will be glued to the near post and still somehow concede.",Posted: October 1,Recommended,141.2 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Just better in every possible way from FIFA23. More natural, better gameplay. Career modes (both player and manager) tweeked and upgraded. Online many more options. FUT exciting as ever. All round real solid showing from EA, which isn't to be taken for granted these days. I recommend. Not sure if worth the initial price, if somebody buys every year, but definitelly worth if you want to come back to the series after a break. Lots of new stuff and just adjustments for the career modes - all beneficial!",Posted: October 2,Recommended,63.7 hrs on record,"2 people found this review helpful

slow lethargic gameplay which again is pay to win, so if you wanna actually have an enjoyable experiance you best also have £200-500 to sink into ""FC Points""

Problems
Taking a corner, goal kick, penalty or free kick results in 10fps view (10fps is being kind)
No fouls are given when a player just runs through you
Goal keepers literally dont have a brain
Defenders who are 86 rated plus can not keep a defensive line one always drops deep deliberately to play onside the attacker

Why does defending becomes so hard, even with the Legacy Setting. I come from Fifa 21 where defending is much more reasonable, where you can press square to stand tackle. The defending setting is very confusing, and eliminating the setting that I enjoy the most.
The idea of mixing female footballer is very stupid, I mean who ask for this? most of my feminist friends does not even play football game. We are better off if they spend their money to improve the game rather than buying license that no body ask for.
I have played Fifa since Fifa 17 and this is the worst so far. In fact, I'm starting to enjoy E-football, not because it is better than PES, but this game is so bad.",Posted: October 5,Not Recommended,2.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Defenders are like magnets,
You can tackle someone and they shoot through the tackle.
All you have to do to win is ball roll a couple times.
Easier to let AI play and win the game for you.
Game somehow got worse.
Game about realism yet women and men are bunched together, got women rated higher than top tier male players for some reason.
New hyperx ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is a great edition that nobody uses and is entirely useless since normal players want to play and not watch replays.

I bought this game to cure boredom and full fledged expected to not enjoy too much. It exceeded my expectations although I think a different name would do more justice, hows about... George Floyd simulator... I know what you all are thinking, oh this dudes crazy, but no I am just coming off a string of div rivals losses due to the Simulator in question (I think this is a fair enough reason to justify this). If you want to feel like space is nonexistent and everyone is defending you with such ease be my guest and buy it to test that theory out. I genuinely am privileged to be this enlightened by EA for showing me how Derek's knee really felt. Really took being in someones boots to the next level except it was police issued boots not football boots. And I honestly think I am going insane over this game the analogies I have made on discord calls are the most whack ones yet and this was just an example of that.

I would recommend if you play a style where you just defend and defend then twist and turn like crazy then this game is for you. If you want to play good, realistic football where you have to pass to find space and you actually can play through the midfield better luck next year... I wonder what tragedy they are gonna strive replicate then, maybe Pearl Harbor would be a good baseline. (The only sentences that were not jokes were the two preceding the conclusion, but seriously if people could stop twisting my ♥♥♥♥ off with a fast winger I would appreciate it ;),

games actually so poorly optimised..
taking free kicks, corners and goal kicks are run from a powerpoint slideshow
somehow they've made changing players when off the ball even worse
no one cares about ""hypermotion"" or any of this ""realistic"" crap.. just give us an optimised game that runs smoothly at, at least 60fps..
games set to 1 volume for everything but for some reason some aspects of the game still blow out my speakers and others i cant even hear..

I don't get how each fifa gets worse and worse.

The defender that's taller than Goliath was rumored to be is smaller than someone with the pace of turbo from the best movie of all time: Turbo. The goalkeepers get beaten from 30 meters away or 100 hotdogs away for you americans.

You can see that this game is made by an American company because they've obviously never watched a proper football game in their life. The game doesn't work properly like Americans that need to hire impoverished Mexicans in order to keep necessary jobs filled.

Learn to make a game, then make a good version of Fifa, and then go eat your own nutsack for all the pain and grief youve caused us over the last decade.

( Faded than a ho ) Like when i be hitting them ohio blinkers i be finessing some of that sigma rizz. I donate to Kai cenat gyatt streams all the time!

Like previous comments, this game is unfortunately a monopoly and there are no other options to play football with your friends and such. Mechanics and graphics have improved which I like.

What really pisses me off is how EA is giving into this stupid woke culture and gender equality ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so much so now they have partially ruined FUT for many players. It is POINTLESS to spend the effort in FUT Weekend or other tough competitions which demand huge focus and stress, to then be rewarded with a woman as a player? It really just eliminates the immersion and realism. In real life, women cannot compete with men in both the physical and mental level of this sport.

I like it.

It's my first Fifa/FC game that I've bought to actually play and I really like it.
Some things can be improved sure.

But I don't have any problems with performance or bugs really. There's the one bug with the mouse where you can switch in the menu with the controller, but you just need to move your mouse again and then it works... sure, it can be annoying but it's not game breaking.

I like that there are a lot of rewards to play for and aim for - and for me who's new it's cool to learn all the new things etc. and try everything out. I get that veteran players probably have deeper understanding and can better say what's bad.

Sometimes there can be weird things where you try to challenge/fight an opponent with the ball but it's feels like there's an invisible bubble around him and your player just dances around him - but that's maybe also because I'm still learning everything.

But for me, a new player, I like it so far.",Posted: September 29,Recommended,30.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I know what EA do all the year long: Making another trailer for us and change the game from bad to worse . I have never played in a game with so many bugs - NEVER . I have a strong PC but my game is lagging as hell, I was forced to play 1080x720 res , to play normally. Worse and Worse every year . Servers are lagging , it just knock me off during the game from ultimate team - I am loosing the game + my reputation . Also cheaters . I played 3 Drafts ... 2 of them was lost to cheaters , the match is starting they are doing a pass and I am out from your servers , I gain a loose and I lost the draft and the cheat is so good that I do not gain a played draft match in the objectives . DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR SH!TTY GAME !!!!

Update: Controller is working very very bad , you can play 10 matches in a row np , but the next one it does not work in the game, it works in the menu, but not in the game and you can not do anything about it , you just have to quit the game and start a new one and guess what ? IT WORKS AGAIN !!! how, why , for what ? Optimize it for your players , you are on a good way to loose a lot of your clients ! You are doing good EA , if that is your goal.

UPDATE:
-It's 24.10 Mariah Carey started to sing ""What I want for Christmas"" and they still did not remove the kick of glitch on Fifa.
-The menu is still crushing when you are doing SBC/creating squads or buyng players .
- Ladies are stil OP .
-The "" Y"" or ""trianlge"" pass does not work in this game, you can remove the button from your gamepad .
-Ground pass are still sh1t , 1/2 passes are going to the wrong direction that you wanted to go and thinking that pasing with R1 will help- you are naive.
-Swiching players ? forget , the game will switch to the player the game wants , not the closest to the ball or the defender who can cover the ball
-Broken animation , where you can clearly see how the scrips work when a defender want to get the ball from you and usually ladies are glitching because of the 1.65 m heigh but defending better than Van Dijk.
-Very often super long distance curved/trivella goals - very realistic !

Looks like I am crying a lot on this one. Yeah it's because they ruined the game I love and it is imposible to play now without laughing how bad it is. I am not a newbie , I am also not a cyber microwave , I did 9 wins on WL(not great , not terrible) , I am a regular fifa player , have been in this game since 2005 and I am suffering because EA gives a ♥♥♥♥ on people like me and pay more attention to cyber microwaves who are playing the game 24/7 and learning all the glitches and donating money in this game, cause PAAAAACKS - are super exiting.

Basically the same game as the year before but worse PC optimization, with time EA also couldnt care less about team licensing, which is why we lost some national teams and clubs. Just a few new gameplay changes like ""Playstyles"" (Similar to traits in FIFAs), precision passing... little additions but even more bugs, errors and such. The real joke is buying Ultimate Edition or even worse FIFA Points (Dont buy them, not worth it for any price) with many people not getting their Ultimate and Pre Order rewards and have to contact EA support to even get them.

This game is horrific. Crossplay has been broken since launch. Glitches ruin the core gameplay. My username is a random set of 20 letters and numbers.

Shockingly the only thing worse than the game has been Steam's support. My initial refund request was seconds over the 2 hour limit and they have since denied every request I made. I spent most of my time trying to get various features to work or connecting to servers.

Absolutely avoid purchasing this game. Hold off until they start bleeding money and then snatch it up at a bargain.

This game is a complete disaster. The optimization is beyond atrocious. Even on a top-of-the-line PC, it struggles to maintain a paltry 70 frames per second. And don't get me started on what happens during corners, cutscenes, or set pieces—prepare for a jaw-dropping nosedive to 7-10 FPS.

The developers couldn't care less about fixing these glaring issues. But of course, who needs performance when you can throw in some SBCs, right? It's infuriating!",Posted: October 21,Not Recommended,80.1 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

♥♥♥♥ and ball torture (CBT), penis torture or ♥♥♥♥ torture is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, kneeing or kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.",Posted: October 20,Not Recommended,80.0 hrs on record,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

Good, tbh, I thought it was going to be the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Last Fifa I played was 19, and that ♥♥♥♥ was unplayable as single player, bad teams got on roids, and yours gets dumb when the game wanted you to lose, and even if you played near impeccable you where going to lose. FC24 does the same but if you play good you can over come it. In my opinion this mechanic is interesting because stuff like like that happens IRL. I'd say it can be tweaked a bit more to make it a bit more balanced. 7.5/10",Posted: October 20,Recommended,88.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

worst fifa (yes its exactly the same despite the name change) ever released.

FC 24 uses the exact same assets as the past 5 fifa games. Commentary voices, animations, customisation items, AI intelligence and much more are literally the exact same assets from FIFA 23/22/21/20 and even fifa 19.

This is standard for fifa, although despite using the same assets this is by far the buggiest one yet.

Frequent game crashes, infinite loading screens and plenty of game breaking bugs including invisible players.

As for game play... It's EXACTLY the same as every other fifa game just with updated squads and kits. The only noticeable changes is the menus and music.

Also the HUD is awful. In-game camera angle cuts the bottom of the pitch off, which is fine, but also the minimap fades to the point its basically not viewable or in some instances (free kicks) it will vanish completely, meaning if you're playing clubs you literally cannot see your player or what is around them.

Difficulty settings are unrealistic. On world class, every team plays like prime barca. On legendary, MK dons play like Barca whilst your 1bn value Man City squad have the ability of 50 rated players. Clubs AI also feel really good some games and then are terrible in others.

Only buy this game if you want to play online with friends using cross platform. If not, just buy an older fifa on sale and use mods to update the squads. Alternatively just wait for a sale and the bugs to be fixed.",Posted: October 14,Not Recommended,109.6 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

What the hell is the point of having this on steam if I have to launch the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ass EA app every time i want to launch the app. Also playing on PC sucks cause theres no way to send unsolicited ♥♥♥♥ talking messages to you opponent... let me be toxic.

Where do we start...

As someone who NEVER played ultimate team and NEVER spent a single coin except for purchasing the base game, I do genuinely think this game is good overall.

Are you just buying a squad update every year? Yes.
Is it a bad game and not fun to play? No.

I play mainly seasons and career mode and it is actually not a bad game, this year launch on PC is sort of better than 23 -- Too far from being a decent release state, but common... we are talking about EA games here...

If you play Fut and spend money on the game, you are part of the problem, you don't get to complain.

Why a negative rating then? Because this company is just sad and pathetic and can't wait for the day a competitor makes a better game so we all switch.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,16.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

As a fifa fan who hasn't played fifa since 2017, this is a very cool game. For its price sure, it underwhelms but personally I just needed a game to play when im bored and this is perfect.

I have been playing the game for over 50 hours and most of the time I was playing Ultimate Team. Guess what A lot of glitches. it's impossible to get the football back from the opponent because of glitches such as the ball randomly hitting my player and returning back to the opponent, players with 50 physical points defend and get the ball back from the defender who has 80+ physical points, and guess what the defender fall down easily on the ground. I forget about hacks :D there's no chance to avoid them.

A long side of other glitches :D that makes the game not playable.",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,188.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I played FIFA 94 up to 2019. But before 2019 it was disappointment after
disappointment. And stopt playing FIFA (any EA game for that matter)
So after 4-5 years how does the game hold up? My pro & cons.

PROS:
- It has been long overdue, but finally some costumization for own teams is back. Even though its limited, Its very welcome
- Limited stadium costumization
- the game looks okay
- I love football
- Menu's feel responsive
- I like the english commentary teams
- A few support chants are added in the game
- EA still have the licenses for the team and leagues

CONS:
- EA app needed
- 70€ not worht it
- Menu's are a mess. The game has many modes, settings, the menu system doesn't make the clutter any better.
- No commentary issue. I had to download english language pack on steam and then change my language ingame again to make commentary available. Also a brilliant move from EA to have audio for commentary off by default.
- Ultimate team: What a clutter of menu's. Let me play
- Ultimate team: Woman mixed with men? wtf.
- Not really expanded european football. It would benefit UEFA leagues in career
- Womans are in the game
- Volta is the game
- Ultimate Team is in the game
- GenZ braindeath music
- Career mode: Own team: can't choose players
- Career mode: Its basiscally the same career mode as 5 years ago, 10 years even. Only they added some training/coach training paths. It just a waste of time and it only clutter the menus even more with numbers and icons.
-pre-game intro is horrible: I like that tv broadcast experience. Now u see one player training or stepping out a bus. And a second later its kick-off. Were is the TV presentation. Presentation of the crowds, Atmosphere, player line ups are gone
- Everytime a player gets a card i get a POV of the referee. Why? I never saw this in real life.
- Gameplay: standard Time/scoreboard layout is really bad.
- Gameplay: When you score a goal or something the TV information is so fast i often can't read it
- Gameplay: is unbalanced attacking is to easy, defending to hard.
- Gameplay: They destroyed defending when they introduced ""tactical defending"" many years ago. It was never so bad. players just refuse to defend or tackle and rather want to run away. If the bal is ""dead"" and no team has posession. My player will refuse to pick up the ball.
- Gameplay: During a game they rather show all game faces of the goal scores intead of showing the names.
- Gameplay: Set pieces is just the same as last 10 years. The extra information were to hit the ball, and curved trajectory line can make it more easy now.
- The Generic stadiums are the same from 20 years ago. I don't see one new one.
- Career Match day: To change outfits you have to go trough multiple tabs for each game.

better than before they finally use the (X)or(A) button and they remove pushing from (O)or(B) button to (X) but u need to put advanced defend and now u can push without tackling by mistake

+they add upgrade mode(EVO) for some players with specific requirement
+they add orbit dribble
+ they change idea of traits(not big change)still a lot of things are similar

-

negative things are they remove land cross (low curved cross)or(R1 square)or(double square)
+they remove low loop through ball(triangleL1 + R1)
+u barely see any improvement with graphics

Game is fun to play, more options to change this year, kinda like the GUI, Gameplay is different, Crossplay to pro clubs is a great addition need it for a while now, Not a fan of the overpowered crosses tho EA, you fix one thing but then you dont pay attention to the other mechanics that become OP. But overall i like it, hopefully the content in UT isnt over pushed this year.",Posted: September 29,Recommended,195.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Hate EA as a company. This game has terribly slow loading times, Terrible start up time, which wouldn't matter if I didnt have to reopen it every hour cause my controller goes unresponsive at menu screens sometimes, due to EA's utter uselessness. First time Ive bought a FIFA since 2017 and it still has the exact same inputs and mechanics. exact same menus, exact same unresponsive/uselessly coded defence... Nothing has changed in 6 years? Might aswell just of added updates to fifa 2012 then bring out a new release each year with the lack of any sort of changes. But nah EA love cutting corners at every opportunity, they love doing the bare minimum and using their customers as a cash cow, Charging every year for no improvement, turning off old versions multiplayer servers, then the micro transactions in FUT making x10 all the sales. Only reason EA have success is just because EA suck fifa's ♥♥♥♥ and have all the rights to players names, team names, badges and kits. They know nobody can compete. ♥♥♥♥ EA!",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,316.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Review:
I've been a fan of the FIFA series for years, and I have to say that FC24 has blown me away once again! This game is an absolute masterpiece in the world of sports gaming.

Graphics: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The graphics in FC24 are nothing short of stunning. The attention to detail in player faces, stadiums, and even the grass on the pitch is mind-blowing. It's like watching a real football match on TV.

Gameplay: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The gameplay in FC24 is incredibly realistic. The controls are intuitive, and the responsiveness is top-notch. Whether you're playing solo or with friends, every match is an adrenaline-packed experience.

Game Modes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
FC24 offers a wide range of game modes to keep you entertained for hours. From Career Mode to Ultimate Team, there's something for everyone. The addition of Volta Football adds a refreshing street football experience to the mix.

Soundtrack: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The soundtrack in FC24 games is always on point, and FC24 is no exception. The music selection perfectly complements the gaming experience, and I often find myself humming the tunes even when I'm not playing.

Online Play: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The online multiplayer in FC24 is seamless. Playing against opponents from around the world adds an extra layer of excitement, and the matchmaking system ensures you face opponents of similar skill levels.

In conclusion, FC24 is the pinnacle of sports gaming. The combination of jaw-dropping graphics, realistic gameplay, and a variety of game modes make it a must-have for any football fan. EA Sports has outdone themselves once again, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for the next installment.

My controller doesnt work, so I spent $100 to play a game that doesnt work. I even thought my controller was bad, so I bought a new $100 controller. So, $200 deep to play this game, I then load into the game to realize my controller was fine but controllers connected to your PC dont work on Fifa. The cherry on top is that EA has no desire to fix this issue. Check their bug fix board and youll find 0 help on this issue. The fixes released also dont work, Ive attempted everything possible. So, thanks Fifa for stealing my money, If I can sue someone let me know, cause EA is a joke of a company.",Posted: October 14,Not Recommended,32.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Yet another year with another negative review.

Why a negative review well the introduction of Woman to Ultimate Team normally I wouldn't care but you see you got a walkout to realize you got some woman that you won't use and don't know what of waste of points/money.

I did like the Player/Career mode improvements could be a lot better. The game itself is better than Fifa 23 for me personally however Ultimate Edition is not better than the previous ones.

So after Ted Lasso I was actually curious to try a soccer game, and with EA dropping the FIFA name it felt like a good time to give it a shot.

The game took forever to load and ran like ♥♥♥♥ on my monster desktop. It failed to recognize three different controllers, remaining stuck on keyboard and mouse even when I unplugged both.

After I tried and failed to play for about half an hour I gave up and refunded. How does anyone put up with this garbage?",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,0.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

EA lowkey cooking this year, i havent played a fifa game as responsive and as enjoyable as this since 2017, probably my last fifa/ea fc but still this game is really good, despite missing some key things like the commentary and such, it also fixed alot of things that were 'problems' in the past few iterations of this franchise

But the biggest negative point for me is that supermario the goat and the best woman striker greenwood arent in the game yet

(p.s. sakina is the goat and she is better than penaldo pessi pembappe paaland perr pentellas)",Posted: September 30,Recommended,21.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

honestly, game is pretty good but not great. gameplay is a minor improvement overall, crosses dont feel pointless anymore and you can actually score from them which is a big plus, still problems with switching to the right player though. gameplay is a little slower and a little more realistic, graphics are better, but the game could have been so much better with some minor improvements. overall a 7/10",Posted: September 29,Recommended,27.8 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Game is class, people are always going to cry when it comes to fifa ignore the and buy it, gameplay is quite refreshing this year especially in UT with the additions of playstyles and women into the game. Evolutions are a great addition too, think this fifa is miles ahead of last year, had some lag issues at first but changing some settings made the game run great.

The worst optimized game ever. Either get on console or if you want to play on PC , probably get one god pc for 100 trillion dollar and even then you might get stuttering.
If you thought ubisoft optimizes their game poorly, buy this and play once. EA said ""How else can we fk this up now that we have ruined it completely from our side? Ohh i know, lets borrow some ideas from other companies""
Also, steam wont refund this POS. So i guess it will be rusting in my library forever.

At first this is the 2nd best football game EA has done yet. (Beside FIFA 15 of course)

I've felt every difference for the last ""FIFA"" game, they really make a better hypermotion tech every year.
There's some people who had bugs and didn't like the game, and that's their opinion but mine is absolute positive about the game. I haven't had any bug till now.

Anything to improve in the game ?

Yeah maybe they should focus on the clubs matchmaking and servers in general, because I have to wait at least 15 min to play one game and that's a really slow process to level my pro .",Posted: September 29,Recommended,313.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I only buy the game for the new ratings, and new teams in each league but people complain too much about bugs and not many new features in the game, but bugs are things that every game has and they cant be avoided. Also, the new features they have added in the manager and player career modes, that 90% of people wont see cos they're ultimate team rats, are great and add a new twist to the game.

Game runs great even my EVGA 1070 FTW at 1080p. It recognizes my PS5 Dual Sense controller with no uses (Make sure to disable Steam Input).

As for those already complaining about the DRM Denuvo and other security measures, I think it's for the best that those are in place to prevent hacks and other tooling that some bad actors may want to use to ruin the experience during the lifespan of the game. After it's one year cycle, as a publisher/developer I would removed and let the community, hackers, modders, etc do with it whatever they please since this is a yearly produced product that will lose it's importance each year anyways (No, this is not 1994 were you would get revisions for FIFA hopefully and have to re-purchased the cartridges if you even knew which revision it was, welcome to the year 2024 - stop complaining and asking for the old days, go spend over $80+ at Six Flags or move on sir).

For those on Linux (including Steam Deck), I'll fiddle around with it at the proton level and provide feedback to the github repository from my findings since it currently does not run on Linux. Hopefully it doesnt end up like FIFA 2023 were it stayed borked for it's whole cycle..

EA FC 24 - Pushing the Boundaries of Virtual Football

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

EA FC 24 builds upon the solid foundation laid by its predecessor, FIFA 23, offering both familiar gameplay mechanics and exciting new features. Here's what stands out:

Gameplay (4.5/5): The core gameplay mechanics have been refined to offer a more realistic and engaging football experience. Player movements, ball physics, and AI behavior are noticeably improved, creating a more authentic on-field feel. The tactical options have been expanded, allowing for greater control over team strategies.

Graphics and Presentation (4.5/5): The visuals in EA FC 24 are stunning, showcasing a level of detail that further blurs the line between virtual and reality. Player likenesses, stadium environments, and weather effects contribute to a truly immersive experience. The crowd animations and reactions add an extra layer of realism to the matches.

Modes and Features (4/5): The game offers a plethora of modes to keep players engaged. Career Mode sees welcome improvements, with more depth in player development and team management. Ultimate Team continues to be a standout, providing an addictive card-collecting experience. The inclusion of new challenges and events keeps the game fresh.

Online Play (4/5): The online component of EA FC 24 remains a strong point, with smooth matchmaking and a vibrant community. The addition of dedicated servers has significantly improved the online experience, reducing lag and ensuring more fluid matches.

Innovation (4/5): While EA FC 24 doesn't revolutionize the series, it introduces subtle yet impactful innovations. The introduction of new skill moves, refined set pieces, and enhanced player interactions contribute to a more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay.

Commentary and Soundtrack (3.5/5): Commentary remains competent, providing insightful analysis and capturing the excitement of the matches. The soundtrack offers a diverse selection of tracks, although personal preferences may vary.

In summary, EA FC 24 represents a commendable step forward for the FIFA series. It successfully refines existing elements while introducing subtle innovations to enhance the overall experience. With its impressive visuals, engaging gameplay, and a wealth of modes, it's a must-play for football enthusiasts and FIFA fans alike. While there's room for improvement in certain areas, it remains a strong contender in the sports gaming genre.",Posted: October 1,Recommended,11.6 hrs on record,"1 person found this review helpful

The game is horrible.
Why?
1) They added women to UT.
2) Pro clubs wasnt working and glitching out in the menu for like a month (fixed, still wanted to mention)
3) The AI in proclubs is horrible, defence always doing bullshxt and opponent just spamming curved crossed for easy header goals, ai defence cant do anything about it.
4) Ut menu glicthes sometimes and crashes the game (Not fixed yet).
5) They nerfed ronaldo even tho he is way better than most current +90 rated players.
6) Wierd camera glitch on udinese stadium. The camera zooms out when u get closer to the goal.
7) The usual fifa player glitches.
8) The music is a disgrace.

Then why do you play it?

I had 100k coins, i thought you know what im gonna buy a pack i Read the pack description hoping i get something good so i can make a profit and then i open the pack and its full of untradables, there was no specification if this pack was tradable or not. But you would assume a pack is tradable or that it would say that it would be untradable but no i got ripped of 100k coins for a 87 rated modric thats only Worth 20k and a bunch of 84 83 and 82 rated cards none of wich i can use.

Also the gameplay is so bad, my players keep passing to the opponent or the completely wrong direction im aiming. When i shoot the enemy keeper Always saves it even tough i finnese shot with the finnese shot+ playstyle or my players just shoot way of target while im aiming my joystick towards the goal.",Posted: November 10,Not Recommended,279.7 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

After the full game just before the shootout starts if you substitute players then game will never resume. after so long you will have to force quit. this is during squad battles.
during friendlies if you have any defender playing as CDM or CM then that player will never move even if you keep him as drift wide.
during squad battles your connection will suddenly drop and you will lose game as forfeit even though you were winning.
during SBC sometimes it will show random error and kick you out of ultimate team. when you go back in the progress for that particular sbc is not save.

To start: i don't recommend the game. It's riddled with bugs not only in the gameplay, but there's a lot of visual bugs in the UI. The UI also makes no sense and is just a clutter.

Microtransactions are back in full force, and EA are shoving out untradeable packs in the shop. Not only do they want to sell you digital goods that are worthless in a year, but they also want to sell you digital goods that might be useless immediately as you pack them.

Ultimate team gets most of EAs little attention and the other game modes are usually left in the dust. The only positive part about this iteration is improvements to pro clubs and a few for player career. Bugs takes way too long to fix.

The gameplay feels sluggish and non responsive. While this matter is highy subjective, it is in my opinion the worst FIFA/EAFC ever made regarding gameplay.

Conclusion:
The game is really bad, and EA keeps pushing the microtransactions they make billions off with barely any of the money going back in to the game to make it better. The game is riddled with bugs and it takes forever to fix them, if they ever get fixed at all. It just screams lazy, and it's unacceptable that a multi billionaire company such as EA can churn out this garbage with no effort each year.",Posted: November 8,Not Recommended,92.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

the only difference is between FIFA 23 and EA FC 24 is the name
worth getting it only if you play ultimate team but if u want to have fun with friends or play career mode just play 23

P.S. idk how but for me it looks and feels worst it's giving me mobile game vibes

Ive been playing fifa for my whole life and this has to be the worst one by far i play ultimate team and my team is pretty good at around a 85 overall so far and im getting beat by trash teams somehow and that dumb double pass button on defence where they send your player across the field is so broken bc no foul is called and your player is basically way out of the play also passing sucks you aint towards one and it goes to another or forward passes are completly off goalkeepers no matter how good they are will always miss easy saves overall horrible game i have 54 hours played all on ultimate team and its just horrible overall the game looks great but the gameplay itself is super bad and no matter if you put it on team press your team literally wont press you put certain positions with certain instructions and they wont do that either its just bad and being on pc your controller will randomly disconnect and your player will stay running straight overall 0/5 for me being played every fifa till this day since ps2.",Posted: November 8,Not Recommended,54.6 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

First month and a half had 0 complaints, gameplay felt good, loved the introduction of playstyles, and online games felt responsive and smooth. Fast forward to present day, and the game has become literally unplayable for me for the past week and a half. Gameplay is so sluggish, my players are unresponsive (literally run the opposite way when I'm in control of them), and it's absurd. I keep logging in each day hoping its improved, and its always the same thing. I have a gig connection, have been monitoring my frames which have not dropped at all, and the result is still the same, I don't even know what to blame at this point, but in this current state I have no wish to play if it'll continue like this. Should've never made the switch from console to PC because I never had this issue so consistently on PS5.",Posted: November 7,Not Recommended,164.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Signed up for the EA Play to test it out for cheap. Waaay more fun than i expected it to be. I'm not a casual Fifa player so take my opinion with a grain of salt. Last Fifa i played was fifa 11 lol. Alot has changed since then obviously. I've only tried mycareer so far and i have no complaints. 10/10 definitely worth trying through the EA play trial and if you dont end up liking it you can always cancel your subscription.

EA Play only gives you 10 hours of playtime. After that you have to pay for the full price if you want to keep playing.",Posted: November 7,Recommended,6.6 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

One step forward, 100 steps back. I only play Player Career and it's been just sad. Match Rating is completely broken and Season Objectives are outlandish (Take a League Two club to Championship? Best we can do is 10k per wk only if you get 30 assists). This wouldn't be an issue but I run sliders to keep things as close to realistic as possible bc winning 10-0 every match is boring. If you don't meet your Season Objectives, you can't even resign with the club and are forced to move on as a 87 OVR when the rest of the squad only has 68 at most. Player Career was supposed to be a means to ""play your own way"" and it's become more of a chore. This will be my last FC game until they actually fix things.

I am absolutely furious about the no commentary bug on FC24. It's beyond frustrating to invest time and energy into a game, only to have such a crucial aspect of the experience stripped away. The absence of commentary diminishes the immersion and atmosphere that is integral to the gameplay. It's a glaring oversight that should have been addressed before release. This bug has left me feeling incredibly disappointed and it's disheartening to think that such a fundamental issue slipped through the cracks.

I will be brief, the game´s handicap should be illegal. The handicap has been present since FIFA 17, and they won´t remove it simply because it is the way they keep players come back again and again. Don´t get me wrong, I have been victim and benefited with the mechanic, but 2 things are a fact, one, the handicap exists, and the other, they have been lying to us. If you are a long term player, it is impossible that you haven´t notice that the handicap is present in the game, players get slow and dumb without a reason when you are winning a lot, and those that are loosing bad, get a boost on statics. There is actual proof that a message have been reported while playing online that says ""Difficulty changed to professional"".",Posted: November 4,Not Recommended,252.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I would say this game is fun as I play manager career, player career and kick-off so I don't really have to deal with microtransactions, I like the new skill moves for the trickster play style, however this game is probably the weakest of the international teams, no Brazilian national team? Also let's don't talk about how they completely butcher some player's faces like they did to João Neves for an example, I don't believe I have experienced EA scripting or have experienced it to an blatant example of scripting. Overall, it wouldn't say it's a GOOD game but it definitely a FUN game and it's the only football game unless you wanna play Konami's eFootball and random Flash games to play for a Football game.",Posted: November 4,Recommended,61.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This is one of these games you hate and still like somehow and you continue playing it.

One thing I need to mention is the playercareer-mode which almost is unplayable at times on legendary. It doesnt matter which club you play with but your teammates do absolutely nothing and basically lets the other team score. I fully understand that the game should be difficult at those levels but at least make it realistic! Its ridicilous when your team lose every game with 4 - 1 or 6 - 1.

What a bad game. I really can't believe they made it even worse than FIFA 23. Only cutbacks, only AI which makes the game as it wants. I played with really bad players and the game just wanted for them to win. A was prepared this year, I bought the founders edition, played everything, every objective in the first month. Nothing in exchange!
All they care is to make you buy points with real money (wich I never bought and I will never do this), so this game is a PAY TO WIN ONE!
Never buying any EA FC AGAIN in my life! Too bad, it had potential, but it is the worst situation ever!

While FIFA 24 brings some incremental improvements to the table, it falls somewhat short of being a significant leap from its predecessor, FIFA 23. In the career mode, you'll find a limited number of new cutscenes, with a maximum of 10, which might leave you wanting more. Additionally, in the Ultimate Team mode, there's a curious inclusion of troll packs featuring women, which could leave some players questioning their value, especially considering the 70 euro price tag.",Posted: November 4,Not Recommended,110.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I've been playing football games and Fifa since 90's.

This years FC24 edition seems different from previous ones because of one noticeable issue. Gameplay is decent but performed actions, passes, shots, tackles etc seem to be much more clunky than before. Also the DDA seems to kick in way harder. I feel really bad scoring 2-0 in very early match, it feels like it's always going to end something like 3-6 when DDA gives the boost for opponent. Yep, my tin foil hat is on.

I believe ""clunkiness"" is part of DDA and game constantly determines, for example, wether a pass should be delivered to own player or to opponent. This causes unsatisfying interceptions and also ""wow I didn't actually try and/or deserve this""-feeling when sometimes DDA kicks in for me and unbelievable pass completes. Game this year is lacking the satisfying feeling that you've played well or built a good attack. Don't really need to meantion winger+cutback methods...

Is there DDA in competitive multiplayer matches and why would EA make it so?

- Money. More even the matches are, winning or losing, more money people spend on average. Equal matches make people keep playing and want to improve their teams. Huge losses cause players to quit the game and they are worth 0$ to EA. This is nothing new, online gaming has even patented ways to make online matches artificially even and giving players feeling that they should spend money.

In corporate point of view, it would be very stupid to not optimize matches as equal as possible, giving players good feelings and incentive to spend money to FC Points. No board of directors in company this big will ever say ""it's ok let players play fair and let's take whatever they want to spend"". No way. Any such director would be fired on spot. They optimize the player experience if they are even remotely smart.

In players point of view, this of course is very disrespectful and scummy behaviour.

So why this year passes and gameplay feels unsatisfying and clunky? I believe it's the same reason as poor quality of menus, bugs and UI crap. They are doing the minimum they can get away with. Same logic goes to gameplay and DDA especially. Of course it would be possible to use DDA so discreetly or smoothly that players don't notice it, but it would take way much more work, causing metric tons of expenses. Not really what EA does in other fronts, they want to spend the minimum.

Solution? Maybe call them out for DDA. Ask for fair matches. Ask for fair pricing models. Vote for loot box bans in your countries. Any other ideas? Share them in comments!

Ps. I don't care how many wins I get in WL. I just want fair matches, even endin 0-0 or 0-1. I want decent quality product and fair monitization. I want to be relegated in divisions, finding my own skill level and working my skills from there.",Posted: November 4,Not Recommended,126.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

changed my mind, I would not recommend this game
CONS:
This game gets the anger out of anyone when playing online.
My strikers (OVRL 86-89) sprint slower than every defender.
Attacking and defending needs a Master´s degree.
passing simulator until goal
this games is not worth 70 bucks
everything feels clunky and the characters feel like they are on ice when having the ball
tactics and formations do nothing in this game???
tackling in this game is so bad
lots of bugs and issues
basically shoot or miss gameplay, no strategy involved.
PROS:
Gacha
lots of missions and packs (good rewards)
each play takes 6-10 minutes
fun when playing with a friend

the only thing that is fun in this game is the pack opening and the SBC, the rest is meaningless or boring.",Posted: November 4,Not Recommended,189.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

game has been lowkey killing itself over the years we all know this, still we are here playing it, tho not as much as the previous games.
I would say if you wanna roleplay fotball this is probably for you. but for the player who likes having fun, use reactions to an advantige and don't like random ♥♥♥♥ happening at any time. This game is probably not for you.
plus there are toooooo many glitches and ♥♥♥♥ happening constantly, but they will fix a little bit of those troughout the year, instead of just releasing a playable game for the costumer that pays 60-90 dollars for this game. every, single, year.",Posted: November 3,Not Recommended,87.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Glitch-ridden rehash of last year's game. Absolute trashy mess. Career mode is glitchy with ratings and attributes.

What other choice is there? But I have some gripes

The immersion where did it go for career mode? The prematch lineup screens and commentators talking about lineups... the guys walking out onto the field and lining up no idea why this was taken out.

I only play two modes clubs and career mode, the gameplay is okay but there are a lot of minor glitches in the menus and sometimes players. I would of been happier if they didnt mess with the pregame stuff. They really need new cutscenes and please improve the immersion of the game and that feeling of buildup before a game. It's like this made everything to cater around people who play UT.. maybe if they monetized career mode they would improve it.",Posted: November 2,Recommended,70.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

The game outside of UT is perfectly fine, besides the changes made to the training grounds.
Ultimate Team is now even more P2W than it has been any other year. From the very start the big big packs that we wouldn't see till Toty are out in week 1. The meta from Fifa23 carried over making the first few weeks basically unplayable for those that just chill and play for fun. After that it changed to 71 depth, 424/442/4231/442(2)/4222, with pressure after possession lost. This still has not been changed even after 5 or so weeks. The new Evolutions are a great concept but have been poorly executed. Within the first batch of Evos they made 78 Ansu Fati into an 84/85 that was a very cheap replacement for Mbappe with better links. Since then the evolutions have been not so game breaking until this last one where you can make Llorente even better. The DDA still rules supreme and sways matches away from the actually good to cater towards those that are worse. In previous years it was noticeable but not all that drastic to where a game would be decided on who had DDA in their favor. Not in EAFC24 though. In 24 the DDA decides matches unless you can somehow just be that much better. The best players will feel so much worse when DDA kicks in. Mbappe will feel like 78 pace, VVD will feel like a bronze, Courtious would be better replaced with the 1 arm woman. DDA is that bad in UT.",Posted: November 2,Not Recommended,248.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Best ''FIFA'' version of all FIFA.
I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. I remember playing FIFA in 2014-2016 and this version is much better. Graphics are much better and mechanics (gameplay), also players look realistic and this hyper-motion is very nice feature, some FIFA games had this hyper-motion, but I don't know if 2014 version had it, or this newer one might be improved. Overall everything is better from 2014 version and I think many players are just nostalgic.",Posted: November 1,Recommended,7.1 hrs on record,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

This is the worst Fifa I ever played! Impossible ♥♥♥♥♥ going around, but of course if you can play without lag or something. EA does not give a ♥♥♥♥ about pc players. Game always laggy and annoying. (Even I got really good pc and I have really high speed network)
Every upgrade, making game worse, never getting fix.
Not only lag, it sometimes kicks you from the game and you are losing, even you are beating ♥♥♥♥ out of your opponent. For exp. I was playing draft with my awesome team, I won 3 match and last game I was winning like 3-0.
All of sudden, EA just kicked me from the lobby. WTF man!
This kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ always going around and if I mention about the packs. AWFUL!!!

Online is almost UNPLAYABLE!!! Every single command you do (pass the ball, switch players, sprint, etc) will come after a 3-4 second delay, even longer if you or your opponent have a connection that is not fast enough, you can imagine how terrible the match will be when it is slow like that.

the game is not realistic and has a lot of mechanic problems. The game feels also really slow compared to fifa 23. The game in general is not fun anymore to play. Also the input delay is crazy in this game. Something about this game feels really off. I know my opinion doesn't mean anything but still needs a lot of fixing.

As someone who only plays career mode, I think this game is more focused on FUT/online modes more than ever before. They removed the pre-match cut scenes maybe to cut everything that is game related because you're gonna skip it anyway when playing online. I don't know if it's a bug but there's no commentary when I'm playing player career mode (haven't tried with other modes yet). Also, I don't know if anyone experienced getting booted out of the whole game when you got disconnected because ea app has to restart. At least they changed the menu though, and other minor improvements.",Posted: October 31,Not Recommended,5.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Bang Average!
i have been playing fifa since the past 15 years, but this year has to be amongst the top 3 worst FIFA'S of all time
1. The game is poorly optimized for PC. i switched to PC over the last year and this is my first FIFA on PC, boy oh boy it is awful. I have spent so much time just to get this game to a playable state ( I have a more than powerful PC for this game)
2. The DDA/ scripting seems to be getting out of hand this year, some games your players are good and the next they feel like bronze players.
3. The gameplay is very poor, feels like the engine isnt optimized properly - the ball keeps on bouncing back to opponent after tackling,
Conclusion: My love for football keeps me returning to FIFA because its the best football game out there, but hopefully next year we get a better football game from other developers.",Posted: October 30,Not Recommended,178.3 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

This game is the worst football game ever made fifa 23 renamed FC24 with more glitches and bugs.
AI scores in first minute, i eventually go 2-1 up then AI scores in last minute.
AI out muscles and out runs me an AI with 63 pace out paces my winger with 84 pace.
League 2 teams play like Man city with back heels ,overheads and turns on a six pence.
I am running away with the title and get beat 4-5 nil by teams at the bottom of the league
with 4-5 shots to my 15-20 shots.

Terrible soundtrack. I skipped last year's FIFA after the last 5+ were basically the same game...this is no different or worse. The soundtrack has zero bangers. 0/10 bangers. So many good bangers out there but when they were picking the soundtrack they unchecked the bangers box in the filters.
All that being said - it's FIFA and everyone should know what they're signing up for at this point unless they're a yung gamer or have CTE.

Purchased the game strictly to play Pro Clubs and while I'm aware I haven't mastered all the (new) mechanics of the game (since my last FIFA was FIFA 14)... the game is absolutely horrific.
Riddled with bugs, extremely clunky and incredibly infuriating in certain scenarios.
There's pro's and con's to this game...but it as of right now (28/10/2023) it feels like an alpha title...not even a beta release.
---
There is a new ""training"" feature in pro clubs - allowing you to get up to 4000XP every week. Sounds great right? Except, once you complete the training session - the UI bugs out and the only way out of it is to force shut down the game and re-launch. 10/10.
---
The passing has all gone to crap. Forget about through balls in 90% of the situations. AI's also don't know how to through ball with majority of the balls getting intercepted by the opponent's AI.
You used to be able to use skill moves to get past AI opponents - not anymore. The guy will cover and jockey you the entire time until you take a slightly heavier touch and lose possession. The only time skill moves work on AI's is when they bug out and miss a tackle.
Set pieces (Free kicks, corners) are absolutely horrendous. The good old days when you had to use pure intuition and skill to score? Gone. Replaced with an awful ""guided aim"" where you have to select your curve and direction. 2.9 of a bar? Well - sorry champ, the ball drops down to knee level of the keeper. 3.0 and above? Oh, well good luck saving it!
---
The balancing between tackling and issuing commands to AI is passable at best. When you're instructing the AI to clear the ball (Press B or O), half the time you end up tackling the air yourself - and if you're unfortunate enough you give away penalties or free kicks. Outstanding!
---
As for the experience with online players? Funnily enough it's greatly improved since I last played a FIFA title - with the exception of a few, my experience has been as an overall positive.
I prefer the new system where you have to invest points in your skills (shot power, passing etc.) - but with the passing so bad, I found that there's little to no point investing your points in that skill tree.
---
There's potential for this game, but the rate at which bugs are fixed and patches are released right now is anything but Agile DevOps. I feel like this game was left with a skeleton crew to support the release and moved on the the ""EA FC 25"" title; where majority of bugs are still probably going to prevail and they'll sell you a new ground-breaking feature that nobody uses and everyone skips through.

It is actually the most disgusting game ever created, my keeper couldn't stop a two year old's shot but when I shoot the opponents goalkeeper becomes prime Manuel Neuer. Not to mention the run by the post, pass and a tap in, if u do that no one loves u and i hope u swing. Never buy it, its complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and scripted, ive lost my ♥♥♥♥ so many times on this game that if i ever saw someone i played against irl id clock them.

Hey, I'm a pretty casual FIFA, or I guess now its FC24 but a very casual player none the less. The FIFA I've been playing for a long time now was FIFA17, great game, still play it a bunch. I thought to myself, it's been 6 years, might as well try a new one. So i picked up this. There are some new features I didn't have in 17 so I had some fun messing around with the newer features and everything like that. been playing for about 24 hours as of writing this. And I can confidently say I'm having a good time! yeah sometimes it makes me want to throw my controller in an active volcano, but that's just FIFA. There are bugs here and there still, but most of them aren't really game changing and I've mainly laughed when I've gotten them since most of them in my experience are just silly glitches. Some thoughts though if you want a pros and cons list:

Pros:
-Some new ♥♥♥♥ was added, hooray
-New soundtrack is pretty awesome, I enjoy FIFA17s more though
-Okay career mode, I do miss the actual career with the VA and stuff though

Cons:
-Some bugs here and there, not that big of a deal though
-Ai can be pretty goofy sometimes, can get annoying

Final Thoughts:
Hey, listen, if you haven't picked up a new game in a while, give this one a try, you can always refund it! (Just make sure you haven't played for over 2 hours unless a really nice steam employee gives mercy upon your soul) I haven't ventured to online yet, so I'd look to other reviewers for that. All in all, I like the game from a casual perspective. Hope this helps and have a good day!",Posted: October 27,Recommended,30.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Terrible game, nothing has really changed from when I last played 4 game series ago. It is also laggy AF, even with a 3060TI and a decent AMD CPU. Literally above system reqs. and the game doesn't run well. It just keeps getting worse with each game they bring out.

Probably the worst fifa of all time in contest with fifa 19 gameplay= run down the wing adn jsut cut back and score on on empty goal the defenders just stand there nor marking or anything, so boring everybody is playing the same ♥♥♥♥ tactics and u have a worse team you almost have no chance at winning, dont get me started with the bugs that were left in the game at release tricster+, menu freezing randomly, fines shot+ etc.

My game froze and said I was using 3rd party cheats which I definitely wasn't. Since then:

Even though my players are rated 10-12 points higher than every player the opponent has, I lose every 50/50, my GK hasn't saved a shot in 7 games in a row and they shoot from almost anywhere. They're faster with the ball even though my pace is 90+ and theirs is 80. I don't know if the matchmaking is just trash because I get beaten by 10+ goals most games when I was winning almost every game before scoring 5+ goals a game. The game didn't lag and is now starting to lag a lot where it freezes and and now disconnects from games which negatively impacts my progression and coins etc.


I highly recommend not getting the game.",Posted: October 24,Not Recommended,142.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

i wasn't going to buy this game this year, would have been the first fifa i hadn't owned since before it was even called fifa back in 88, i hate the fact women have been added to FUT, not because they don't deserve it, but the opposite they deserve there own, its getting so unrealistic its a joke, the womens and mens game are completely different, and when i see women players being rated higher than Kane, or CM's the same rating as De Bruyne its just not fair or funny.
however some of the much needed changes to career mode intised me into giving EA one last chance before i give up completely, i love career mode, pro clubs and manager mode (manager the most) and they have been neglected for years now so ea can focus on the cash cow that is FUT and i do enjoy FUT but the amount of games needed to keep up for none micro transaction players is a joke, however i will concede that FUT has been much fairer the last 3 years.

kinda like rocket league if it was released on the Gamecube; inconsistent frame rates on a 3070ti, too buggy at launch

Defending is horrendous, if you're not on 71 depth you get cooked, cutbacks FC, pay to win, 20 elite div wins gets you a GOLD PACK UNTRADEABLE

Career mode is similar to the last FIFA, a little boring some more interactions and different scenarios would be good. (You can''t even do interviews).

This possibly has to be the worst Fifa ever made. Compared to this FIFA23 feels like a GotY!

1. Horrible Input Lags and Delays. Random crashes and Menu bugs reported by thousands of players.

2. The gameplay is absolute trash. The defenders don't defend, attackers don't move or make any runs at all.
Goalkeepers are probably the worst ever, if you charge the keeper he will 10000% miss the ball, one skill move and keeper is rendered useless, people will score against you far post goals at 180° and sometimes even near post.

If you're looking to play fifa I would recommend getting fifa23 and skip this year altogether.",Posted: October 22,Not Recommended,86.4 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

TL;DR Online modes are rinse-and-repeat of previous installations. Too many bugs/recycles that cause soft locks or diminish overall experience during career mode. Most of the new mechanics are either inconsequential or contribute to the issues plaguing career modes...
.
.
First things first, the parts of this game that function are nothing too special. FUT and Volta are decent but only because EA can dig deeper into consumers' pockets with these modes. Haven't had a chance to try out Pro Clubs or any online friendlies since my friends respect their time and money but nothing seems changed about these modes at face value.

The vast majority of problems are in career mode. The new coaching system on manager career soft locks when you go to fire a coach. Player career contract is hit or miss whether it'll actually allow you to renew or force you to settle for signing somewhere else. The required and optional objectives for contract negotiation are a welcome addition if they actually worked... Tackling rate contract objective doesn't seem to track correctly if your player doesn't take on any defensive duels to update the state beyond 0%. And the continued existence of the team possession match objective is pretty lame. Why should I be punished if the opponent AI is playing it safe with possession or my own team's AI doesn't properly mark or clear in a meaningful way to reestablish possession?

But if I want to nitpick the lack of UX consideration on EA's part a little more, I'd say the completely unchanged pool of press conference dialogues and news articles is still a big thumbs down even with a few new cutscenes for Player of the Season, Ballon d'Or, and winning leagues/cups. Is there a shortage of creative talent in Canada and Romania I don't know about that means this game has to keep all text-based interaction at a 2nd grade reading level?

And lastly, the new mechanics just don't feel impactful in a good way. PlayStyles feel like nothing more than traits under a different name. The manager career coaching helps keep players in-form but it would be nice to be able to fire a 2- or 3-star coach for a 5-star without the game freezing up. It would also be nice to experience contract negotiation as a player in a similar manner to the manager career counterpart... ""Signing"" a 1-year each season doesn't feel as authentic as being offered a long-term contract or putting a release clause in your own contract during negotiation. Plus what good does a contract system do when certain teams flatout refuse to sign you for not making enough sliding tackles as a CM or CAM?

I've been picking up FIFA almost every year since 2011 and I genuinely hope EA can address the issues with their undercooked rebrand from FIFA to EA FC. Unfortunately it's more likely that they'll find a way to butcher the series just like Sim City and the Sims. Alright, meandering review turned rant is over. To the readers, thank you for your time and I hope your eyes meet my vitriol again the next time I have another first-world-problem conniption over some EA shenanigans.",Posted: October 22,Not Recommended,65.8 hrs on record,"2 people found this review helpful

Honestly, better than people have been saying. Really like the new menu and home screen look and layout. Game itself, pretty good. Not come across many bugs at all yet surprisingly.

worst game ever made
Just imagine that you play like playing gambling that has been arranged by the bookie, when you have a lot of wins there your team will be nerfed completely until passing the ball to the team falls apart even players who have a high rating become very slow.

What do you expect when a game dev gives like this? This attacks the mentality of every player and damages their brain.

I have no idea why but three games in and there is suddenly an inexplicable black line with cursor extending from the receiver of the ball whenever he collects it, then he follows that straight black line without any buttons working. I can change other players and move them around while this is happening, but there is no clue why on earth this has happened and how on earth to reset it. The first two games were fine.

Concerning all Player Vs CPU Modes/Gameplay: An assortment of laughably incomplete and half-baked ideas that are currently implemented much better in other sports games regardless of type or year of release. I could post this exact same review for the last 10 FIFAs/EAFC Titles. Again, only concerning PvCPU, there is nothing fun, challenging, dynamic, authentic, or with depth about this title, or the last 10 for that matter. Fundamental flaws have existed - by choice and arrogance - for nearing two decades, and simple QOL bugs still exist that can be spotted and fixed in a weekend by a novice Bethesda RPG Modding hobbyist. Sprinkled here and there with some useless annual aesthetic/ambiance additions and you get the yearly release of EAFC's Singleplayer experience.",Posted: October 21,Not Recommended,41.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

So You pay and than you pay some more and some more..and then you get a card that is good for a while until they make new cards of course better ones so the ones you got get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and repeat replay all arround again and again...The main issue, the game is not fun..so just that you know what you getting.",Posted: October 20,Not Recommended,143.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

games are so inconsistent, never know if ea wants you or the other guy to win. Your team plays different every game, and overall a pay to win game. They still have not learned to listen to the community to make their game better. All EA care about is dropping packs for you to give them your money. Game SUCKS. If you want to rage everytime you play a game this is the game for you. Already on my 3rd controller. DDA (dynamic difficulty adjustment) is without a doubt in my mind, in this game.

This is the first EA Fifa/FC game I bought at release. I had picked up FIFA 23 during the world cup sale for half off and it was fun so I tried this.

Ultimate team is basically just a pile of FOMO and the worst micro-transaction tactics imaginable. I got 30 hours out of it with my pre-order points and since I don't want to play hours everyday and grind or spend more money that mode will just move past me.

The rest of the modes are ageing and abandoned.

Is the core game fun? Yes, will I get my moneys worth out of this year? Yes

But I'm down voting it on the principle of its business model and the fact that they will try and do it again next year.",Posted: October 20,Not Recommended,40.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

After 30 years, not much improvement in game play other than fantastic graphics. Still, we have the same animations for about 5 years and EA doesn't care much to do about it.
I'd still recommend having it as we do not have any alternative.

One of the worst iterations of FIFA so far.

The game is littered with bugs, stutters and glitches. By far the most buggy FIFA game so far, the updates have never addressed any of these issues on PC.

I am lagging on squad battles which are supposed to be single player, online FUT is even worse.

How is a triple a game that cost you 70 Eur have so many bugs ?
1-Clubs had an issue where we weren't able to start a game
2-Also in clubs i want to earn points by training but after the first dribble / sprint training the screen disappear and you can only alt f4 ( and you lose the progression )
3-Why all the volume sliders are set to 1 but somehow in the star of a game if for some reason someone decides to not skip the entry i am forced to listen it like it was 500% volume high ?????
4-Also why dont you have made a simple record feature to record some of my goals / highlights ??? i need to have 3rd party software to be able to do it...

FIFA 24 (FC 24) Game Review: Is It Worth the Upgrade From FIFA 23?

Introduction:
FIFA 24 (FC 24) is here, and if you're a die-hard football fan with over 20 hours in FIFA 24 (FC 24) and 400 hours in FIFA 23, you might be wondering whether it's worth the investment. In this review, we'll break down the good and bad aspects of the game to help you decide whether or not to buy it.

The Good:

Realistic Graphics and Animations:
FIFA 24 (FC 24) continues to impress with its lifelike player models, stadium details, and crowd animations. The game's visual quality remains top-notch, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics:
FIFA 24 (FC 24) introduces improved ball physics, more precise player control, and better AI decision-making. These changes make for more realistic and enjoyable matches, especially in one-on-one situations.

New Game Modes:
The addition of exciting game modes like ""Street Football"" and ""Custom League"" offers diverse ways to enjoy the game beyond traditional matches, providing hours of entertainment.

Authentic Soundtrack:
FIFA games are known for their soundtracks, and FIFA 24 (FC 24) is no exception. The music enhances the overall gaming atmosphere and keeps you pumped throughout your gaming sessions.

Ultimate Team Enhancements:
If you're into FIFA's Ultimate Team mode, you'll appreciate the enhanced features, including new player chemistry dynamics and fresh challenges.

The Bad:

Microtransactions:
FIFA 24 (FC 24), like previous editions, heavily relies on microtransactions. While you can earn in-game currency by playing, the grind can be frustrating, and the temptation to spend real money remains a concern.

Minor Bugs and Glitches:
No game is perfect, and FIFA 24 (FC 24) has its share of bugs and glitches, which can be frustrating, especially in online matches. Some issues may impact the overall experience.

Limited Innovations:
While FIFA 24 (FC 24) makes incremental improvements, some players might feel that the changes are not groundbreaking compared to FIFA 23. It can make the upgrade seem less essential for some gamers.

AI and Referee Issues:
Occasionally, the AI and referee decisions can be questionable, leading to frustrating moments that feel out of your control.

Conclusion:

Should you buy FIFA 24 (FC 24) with over 20 hours in FIFA 24 (FC 24) and 400 hours in FIFA 23? It depends on your priorities. If you're a dedicated FIFA fan who enjoys the updated graphics, refined gameplay, and new game modes, FIFA 24 (FC 24) could be a worthwhile investment. However, if you're content with FIFA 23 and find the microtransactions and minor bugs off-putting, you might consider waiting for further improvements in future editions.

In the end, FIFA 24 (FC 24) is a solid entry in the series, but whether it's worth the purchase largely depends on your personal preferences and how much you want to stay on the cutting edge of virtual football.",Posted: October 17,Recommended,21.7 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

The game is basically a remake of 22/23! I'm a bit dissapointed but it seems cool to me, you have new features.

Game overall is well done. Feel its the most enjoyable in a few years. Biggest rat move this year is dribble to otuch line and coming up for cut back sweat. OVerall is balanced if you know what your doing and the sprint merchants get slapped up. PLaystyles is a great addition that makes players feel different. Some times need to reset PC to get the game to run better but runs super smooth overall and allows for nice dribbling on the left stick with quick touches. Worth a but if you enjoy the Fifa titles and arent trash enough to chase META left and right to compete.",Posted: October 17,Recommended,148.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Gameplay - 2/10
Can't understand how a game that is suppose to be a football simulator have the most arcade gameplay i've ever tried, every game is a goal fest, it doesn't matter if you play against AI or against other players, the score will always be 7-4, 5-2, 10-1 etc...
Another big problem about is just how unrealistic the players move, look like they are doing ice skatting in the field... and players with 190cm and 80kg move with the agility of a ninja...

If you looking for PvP only attacking football with defense and midfield being useless this is your game... if you like a little career gameplay it's unplayable as the roleplay will be horrendous as every match is just unrealistic.

Graphics- 6/10
Graphics are good, maybe the strongest asset in the game, ambientacion looks awesome but the player models could be better.

Audio- 7/10
Nice soundtrack as always for a EA football game.

Difficult- 5/10
Game isn't difficult, just the defenses AI is just one of the worst ever... They don't react and attackers are too overpowered and unrealistic fast compared to defenders. Game needs to have a new control system to defend and make it actually fun and useful.

Grind- 1/10
Infinite grind if you are poor, easy if you are rich, 100% pay to win game.

Game Time- 8/10
If you into this game you can play it for many many hours do to his replayability and many game modes.

Price- 2/10
Another EA football game update at a full triple A game price... ridiculous",Posted: October 17,Not Recommended,5.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I have been playing FIFA/EAFC on and off since the early naughties and this is probably one of, if not, the glitchiest release to date.

I have only really ever been interested in the career mode aspect of FIFA and tend to usually play football manager as it is more realistic. I knew this would have been a more arcade experience but golly gosh. Playing as Celtic in the English League Two (just to learn the game) I was sacked for not qualifying for the last 16 of the champions league (I wasn't in it) and also for failing an objective to sign 2 players of different nationality to the club? I signed 8 non Scottish players, 7 players that weren't English just in case that counted. Nope apparently every player is from Scotland in this game.

The last FIFA I played regularly was probably FIFA 12 and yes, graphics and gameplay are much much better in this addition, however, I cannot help but feel that progress since has been underwhelming.

In summary, poor game and would expect more for the money, I'd just wait for FM24 to be released this week if I were you tbh",Posted: October 16,Not Recommended,29.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Genuinely the worst Football title EA have ever released.
-Hardly any improvements over last year.
-Still includes tonnes of bugs and glitches.
-The scripting and DDA is so visible in this game it's ridiculous.
-Run down the line and pass across goal is a guaranteed 0 skill goal every time.

Can't be arsed to write anything more, if you're lucky enough to have not bought this game/have played under 2 hours of it, refund it/do NOT buy it.

Edit: Scripting and DDA is horrendous borderline unplayable",Posted: October 16,Not Recommended,139.9 hrs on record,"1 person found this review helpful

for the past 10 hours of playing this god forsaken game its time to refund this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
i cant lie the game looks beautiful but wtf is with the movement of these players? it feels like im moving on the moon.
the defense on this game is another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level. it feels like im playing against the best and I MEAN THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BEST defense in the world. it comes down to me coping or trying to create mental gymnastics in my mind to see what good can come out of this game,,, none what so ever.
Passing is atrocious. MY Career player has already reached the 85 overall and it feels like im playing a 65 overall player. I can't pass full power cause it will just bounce off the player but if i pass it mid bar it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looks like i kicked those heavy weight balls you use for training.
Interceptions make no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. how did fifa 23 go from simple interceptions and getting called a foul but in this game the AI looks like im playing MADDEN 24. its almost as if im playing against messi and he just payed off all the refs in this game so i lose in the end.

I have bought and played every installment for the past 10 years. This is by far the worst in terms of gameplay. The features and main aspects of the game are great but the gameplay is atrocious. Given this is a sport game, gameplay is definitely the most important aspect. It is bad.

First ""Fifa"" game I have bought in 5 years because of stale and minimal yearly improvements.
Last ""Fifa"" game I will buy for at least 5 years because of awful player experience and awful UI.

The definition of bad game design is penalizing the player through absolutely no fault of their own, this game does it in spades. For example turning up the difficulty makes your own players play like they have never played a game of football in their life, even though they are 86-90 rated, literally to the point they cannot make simple passes or even your 6ft4"" defender with tons of defending playstyles not even being able to jump for a header against a 5""4 player with 50 strength.

Then there are the all to frequent ""super human"" moments where players act like they are literally superhuman, like taking the ball off you from 1 meter or further behind you, turning into Dhalsim stretching and contorting their legs to impossible angles to tackle you after they have already passed you, pinging the ball around like its a projectile and controlling it first time like they have super glue on their boots. The difficulty is also artificially increased by making successful tackles useless as the opposing player gets to keep the ball or insta-tackles you back, usually leaving you out of position and worse off than what you were.

There is also the issue of being dropped from squad battle games after the final whistle where you have won, saying the servers cannot process your request, you then get booted to the main menu and on re-entering ultimate team you are given a 3-0 loss, even though you never once lost connection to the internet or even the game, absolute joke.

The game is literally just an exercise in frustration through bad game design.

UI is just as bad, pray to god you never have to use the transfer market much, search for players with a max buy it now of 23k, says there is none, bump it up to 23.5k, shows hundreds at 23k.
Find a one cheaper and literally 99 times out of 100 it is already sold but wont tell you until you try to buy it, even refreshing the search will show the exact same card again, showing as unsold until you try and buy it again.

You would think that after 3 decades a multi-billion dollar company like EA would have their ♥♥♥♥ together by now but how wrong you would be, they have clearly stopped trying to make the game better for the players and solely focus on how to part you from as much money as possible.",Posted: October 15,Not Recommended,310.2 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

I want to start by saying i've never written a negative review about a Fifa game so don't take this review lightly.

This is why FC24 is the unplayable, genuinely the worst Fifa i've ever played.

- Cannot pass without AI intercepting although your own AI will not intercept passes.
- Tackles are broken, when you win a tackle, you cannot control your player briefly and the AI picks up the loose ball.
- Player switching is broken, it assigns the worst positioned player when switching.
- Stoppage time broken, i cannot tell you how many goals i've conceded in the 96th minute despite there only being 2mins added time, the game AI WILL score 3 or 4 mins passed the allotted added time because it is scripted.
- Pace means nothing.
- GK rebounds are awful.
- In career mode you cannot switch out injured, suspended or player in international duty without creating a new tactic.
- Loaned in players getting upset because i won't give them a new contract.

This really is a poor game but EA won't care because they're still making money.",Posted: October 15,Not Recommended,28.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This is my first review on steam.
I’ve played every FIFA game for about 20 years.

This is the most unrealistic imitation of football in a computer game we have ever seen.

You will see players feet static but them
Skating along the surface of the pitch.

Feet and hands clipping through peoples bodies and the ball.

The ball teleporting into bizarre locations to match the animations of the players.

The players feet and bodies twisting and manipulating themselves into disgusting contortions.

The ball physics are bizarre you can absolutely leather your foot through a ball and it will trickle through your keepers arms, a header at the edge of the box will bullet at unimaginable speed into the back of the net from a soft cross.

It’s an utter utter shambles.",Posted: October 14,Not Recommended,3.5 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

bad game, every important match has been scripted with the AI so that you lose, especially away, and that could make every player pissed, if you want to make it realistic that's not the way to do it, correct EA's bot system, don't make every away or home difficult , make it fair.

EA FC 24 - A Descent into the Abyss of Despair

If you're searching for a soul-crushing, mind-numbing experience that will leave you questioning the meaning of life, look no further than EA FC 24. Prepare to be plunged into the darkest depths of despair:

Crippling Gameplay: The gameplay is like an eternal torment. Players move in erratic, glitchy ways. Controls are a baffling labyrinth, leading to nothing but frustration and anguish.

Surrealism Gone Mad: Realism is thrown out the window as players engage in absurd antics, performing feats that defy the laws of physics and common sense. It's a cruel distortion of the beautiful game.

Endless Empty Modes: The game offers a vast array of empty, hollow game modes that promise nothing but the gnawing emptiness of a life devoid of meaning.

Updates from the Abyss: EA's idea of updates is to plunge the game further into the abyss, making it even more agonizing with each ""improvement.""",Posted: October 14,Not Recommended,111.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This game is absolutely horrible. How they managed to make a game worse than fifa 23, I have no idea.

Firstly, lets start with the menus, the biggest change. It is obvious to see why they do not make big changes like this ever, it is riddled with glitches and bugs that they could not fix in 3, you heard that right, THREE title updates. Which means now and again you have to restart your game because the menu broke.

Next is the gameplay, are you used to the bouncy balloon ass ball gameplay of FIFA? It is here on sterioids, you cannot make clean tackles, the ball bounces around like a yoyo and the opponent always seems to have the ball after.

There is also the AI press that everyone is running, goodluck playing through the middle in this game, everyone results to running down the line and cutting across since they have no other options.

Oh and the keepers? Yeah they might show passion but dont except them to act like they have played a PRO game in their lives. An issue also not fixed in THREE patches. good ♥♥♥♥ EA

There is also the issue with the refs, do not make a tackle in the box or you are getting sent off for sure. They give red cards for the most stupid reasons and the opponent still gets a pen.

Where did all the money saved from the FIFA license go? How can they cut a huge cost and the players see no benefit? This game is frankly insulting as a product. The SBCs released while good are incredibly expensive for FTP players, so guess what there is an 82+ x whatever in the store for you to buy, ♥♥♥♥ the 70/100 USD you already paid.

Pack weight is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful, they added a double walkout animation to sate the gamblers who are addicted to packs while the gameplay is in the worst state it has ever been.

Do NOT buy this game, maybe wait for a sale, wait for a patch next march that will finally make the game playable.",Posted: October 14,Not Recommended,136.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Worst fifa I have played. The defending is atrocious, if the opposing player gets into the box, its basically a goal. Has been dead content in the first few weeks. No good sbcs or objectives, just rivals. The rebounds are back and worse than last years fifa. I can't tackle a player without losing the ball instantly because the ball bounces on the defenders leg and then returns to your opponent. And the goalkeepers. Oh my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ god, the goalkeepers in this game is the worst I have seen in my life. When I tell the goalkeeper to move forward to approach the opposing player so he has less chance of scoring a goal, he runs left of the ball so the opponent has a open goal to score. Every shot on goal goes in, probably 1/5 of the shots on target gets saved. In my experience (playing with 89 rated Ter Stegen btw) my goalkeeper rarely gets a rating above 5.0 and if you don't know, that's a horrible rating. And that's not a rare occurence, that's every game. If you can't trust a 89 rated keeper to save a simple shot, then what's the point of the ratings? Might as well have a 55 rated bronze goalkeeper stand in goal if he is just going to let every shot go into the net.",Posted: October 14,Not Recommended,91.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Gameplay feels as clunky as ever, passing and dribbling doesnt feel responsive, I've seen cows turn faster with a ball than even the best players in this game, opponent computer can tackle through legs and foul for free, goalies are braindead, shooting feels awful, teammates refuse to make runs behind, corners are broken, free kicks feel worse. Overall downgrade from FIFA 23, which was also bad.

Improvements to career mode is appreciated, but barely noticeable. New menu is ok, but not really an improvement on the old one just different.

The game has many errors and loopholes, which, as usual, they will fix with the next updates. The game with glitches is like FIFA 23, but it has been improved with a few things. The game, in all honesty, is not the same as before, but worse and better in a few things. In other words, if you have FIFA 23, do not buy 24. I do not know when it will continue.

I have sang praises about the new game mechanics and UI, it's great but again, the servers are clearly made by people with half a braincell cause the input lag is atrocious when playing any online mode.

The game mechanic is very good .
Passes are awesome.
Many menu bugs.

but none of that matters

Тhe only thing you'll get with this game is a nervous breakdown.
No matter how you play, the winner has already been chosen in advance.
it works both sides.
It doesn’t matter what players you have, what matters is that you will lose if the game decides that.

will try again later

Having played the previous games for many years.

This feels like a step in the right direction. While I have had no issues on PC at present, the game still feels a bit behind the console versions in terms of gameplay and graphical fidelity.

Gameplay feels very similar to Fifa 23 with some obvious changes, such as slight animation changes and better response in controls. Goalkeepers still suck and Ultimate Team is a Rip off.
Season mode is going in the right direction, but I really don't understand how they can add so little in terms of improvements in the game year on year out.

They could easily add all the stadiums from the English leagues / French / Spain / Germany instead of having these random no name stadiums. Perhaps even if you choose the stadiums to have in the league to make it
more immersive ? Story mode should never have been abandoned. Instead Player Career mode should have played similar to that game mode from Fifa's old.

Co-op has been improved in ultimate team.
Same stupid system in Ultimate team. All the packs are still overpriced and takes way to long to save up credits to buy anything decent. Its a £70 game could at least give players some starting fifa coins and credits to help with the whales and over spenders in that mode, but I digress.

Overall its an improved FIFA 23. EAFC 24 should have just been called EA FC since its the first in the series. Fifa have confirmed they are making their own football game so hopefully that will be better than this.

There really is not any other choice in football games on the market. UFL is taking forever to come out and I am fed up of waiting for it. I might switch over to that when it comes out at some point in 2024 / 2025.

Its an average football game. The career mode is fun and Ultimate team is an abomination.
Buy it on sale.
This was a birthday present from my daughter otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.

Lets hope we get a better Football game in the future so I can finally player a career mode in something else. Ha.

*EDIT*

Update.

So after playing a while, the game frequently crashes or hangs in menus for no reason. Completely freezes up. The game does not even trigger ""Not responding"" instead it just keeps consuming memory and CPU.

The game would randomly stutter or freeze on the pitch as well during matches. I am having to manually shut the game down so I can re-load it back up to carry on playing. This happens every 20 - 30 mins. It is extremely frustrating. Which is now I wont recommend this game to anyone until they fix this mess of a game.

PC version is so under cooked and bad compared to the console counter parts.
I dunno why I expected better. Just another mess from EA with a little more paint than usual.
Bit of a joke to be honest. I can't wait until there is a game that rivals this game so I can play that instead.",Posted: October 13,Not Recommended,23.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Better have high end hardware if you want to play anything above 1080p because they cant be bothered to properly optimize for PC.

4/10, have played the in early release for couple of hours and tried again on weekend.
I've played Fifa from last 13-14 years, this years game feels like a beta to me. The menu is indeed clean and easy to navigate but just feels like not alive, the game is same but somehow I don't even think about this years game to take time out for playing. The game maybe be good and I've moved away from playing games could be the reason behind my dislike.

Overall for me - I play this game once or twice in 2 weeks.

Note: I'm not a regular game, will be giving thumbs up for the core game as it is the way it should be.

Player career mode is unplayable on high difficulty cause of terrible AI defenders and I can't even get into clubs games because of their stupid broken servers saying I lost connection to my opponent.. New year same ass game and the worst part is imma keep buying this ♥♥♥♥. EA I truly hope your whole studio of devs retire cause apparently they can't make a single solid game. everything about this year feels horrible and again the only way to win is using a stupid op skill move. This year its spamming the directional nutmeg and god forbid u lose the ball cause the AI will pass it pass your defense before you even have a chance to switch back because of terrible AI positioning. Goalkeeper is also unplayable still and AI goalkeepers suck too and are consistently out of position or deflecting the ball into their own net. I play as a CB in pro clubs and every damn tackle ends up with the ball back at the other teams feet for some reason. Defending just feels pointless because they always seem to just past it past the out of position AI and shoot on a goalkeeper who if makes a save just like tackles it always ends up going back to the other team. That's not a complaint that I suck I genuinely have scored so many goals because of that feature as well. If u buy which I know u will just know this game is still terrible and the EA execs should all be fired and banned from ever being allowed to run a game company again. So sick of this franchise too bad its the only one that offers all these playing options. Was it worth the money, no I'd rather have gotten robbed $70 cause at least then it wasn't my fault I lost all that money for nothing.

Unpacked Pelé…

I’m new to FIFA in general and FC24 is the first one I’ve played. My friend told me to play solo drafts against the AI, so I set it to semi-pro and lost in my third (of five) match…

Got a default gold pack and opened Pelé. Had no idea who he was and almost quick sold him until my friend intervened. (Yes, it should’ve gone to a long-time FIFA enjoyer.)

So, sure, I recommend it. Besides all the bugs.",Posted: October 13,Recommended,203.5 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

For a company which stated that it will be 'new' and 'innovative' game-play is a total lie, the gameplay is probably in its worst state in years. The game overall is clunky and mechanically all over the place, you have some of the fastest players in the game getting over-taken by people with much less pace, you got strong CB's getting man handled by small midfielders and wingers and keepers who are basically non-existent. The game is totally pay-to-win, it is embarrassing that you charge over 100$ for a game which has such a heavy pay-to-win method, literally there has been more store packs then content releases. Releasing 100K+ packs within the first few weeks just ruins the whole marketplace and shows clearly the difference between EA and the community, they do not care about the health of the population and the enjoyment of the players, the only thing they care about is providing store packs with the big what if when you see ""Guaranteed 85+ for two and 31 rare golds"", this cripples the market compared to 5-6 years ago and just makes the game not fun, playing against the same old constant meta-teams with the same tactics and same game-play, rely on auto-defending from AI / AI charge defending, AI press and then getting to the byline and then just cutting it back in for a tap in. For a competitive game, the best rewards should be won via winning games of champs, not loading up EAFC points and going to the store. It is sad because there aren't any alternatives out there similar to FIFA with the same quality and history, the day that company comes and does better, maybe then EA might actually listen to the community and put some good changes in for the community. Rather just attempt to milk its player-base every single year with 120$ for early access, and then countless amounts of store packs in promotion periods, baiting players to gamble rather then rewarding the better players",Posted: October 12,Not Recommended,153.5 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

If you are looking for a game that brings you emotions that you have never felt before, this is it! Feeling anger, happiness, sadness and an emotion that I can't describe all at the same time is normal at this game. Frustration grows when you think you unpacked Mbappe but instead it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ woman. Buying this game also requires you to get at least two controllers for back-up so the actual game costs more than just the game. Even tho I do recommend this game after having multiple suicidal thoughts and wanting to murder someone (usually the opponent, his players and my players).",Posted: October 12,Recommended,197.8 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

its my own fault for buying another ea game.
its really FIFA 23 re-released. The gameplay feels the same and their ""big new feature"" in coaches and tactical styles is a simplified version of tactics that you could already apply in previous games.

The bugs are plentiful and frequent, I've had issues ranging from completely invisible players, players not locking onto the ball and running around it, and horrible misplaced free kicks (i was fouled outside of opp box and i was given the free kick for my keeper in front of my box

As primarily a career mode player, I'm blown away that this franchise still doesn't give you any freedom in customization. Why can't i edit players stats if i want? why cant i disable objectives and prevent being fired? why cant i track player statistics across multiple seasons? there are plenty of restrictions set in an offline mode that just make it harder and less enjoyable.

Not to say its a better game by any means, but there are certainly some features in NBA 2k My GM mode that would be huge addition to the latest stale and pitiful installment of FIFA",Posted: October 12,Not Recommended,27.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Worst FIFA I've played in my life sincer FIFA 17. Gameplay is so unbalanced, they call it ""realistic"". Goalkeeper doesn't exist, it's like I have the goal open. I don't know why they even put goalkeepers in this game if they don't exist. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥, I've payed 70 dollars for this crap and I've gotten bored of it after 20 hours, this happened me to the other fifas after 500 hours.",Posted: October 12,Not Recommended,20.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This game was fine for the first few matches, now the game opens and the EA server is connected, the game closes automatically! Unplayable.
such a waste of money!
Deleting the game and reinstalling it did not help either.

Although this game is full of bugs, which in my opinion is normal because they released it before 15 days, it has great potential and it's fun to play. However some bugs are really annoying like screen-freeze during transfer market in ultimate team and when tackling the opponent for the ball on the ground - you teleport from time to time which is really annoying and not cool. There are some random funny glitches as well, like doing slide tackle successfully, but the opponent recovers really fast and gets the ball back instead...",Posted: October 11,Recommended,64.8 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

My PC is not the issue, all specs of my PC meet or are above the recommended requirements for this game yet I am still having problems with this game.

I've been playing since FIFA21, and I only play the Career Mode.

Just one simple thing: the AI behind the World Class difficulty is just abnormal and ridiculous... It's like your team full of 80+ players but the adversary team can still out-performance you in any aspect. It's frustrating to play in the World Class difficulty, while Professional difficulty is a bit easy. Please improve the AI logic.",Posted: October 11,Not Recommended,17.3 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

While the gameplay engine and general feel of the game is good, the changes doesnt warrant spending money on this iteration of EA's football games over the previous.

Minimal changes to the various single player focused modes, menus that freeze on occasion, FUT is a sad state of affairs and the same bugs (Albeit funny when it happens) during matches.

This being said, I am a huge fan of the series and the sport and the sweet claws of addiction coaxed me into paying for the full product even if I knew full well that I couldve stayed with 23 until a sale came through

All in all, FC24 is not a substantial upgrade over the previous titles from EA, would not recommend paying the full price.

On windows 11 anti cheat seems to have issues launching. All fixes on the internet haven't worked for me. Usually on my laptop (win11) when trying to launch it'll say there's an anti cheat issue. After roghly 30 minutes to an hour it'll prompt me to relaunch the game and then it works fine. No issues I've come across on win10.

For the game play itself.. Its quite good. The game runs really smooth. Some player models are left to be desired. The acrobatic overhead shots look pretty awesome. The AI are much smarter on the harder difficulties. The one thing I would like from EA is to tweak the goal keepers. They never make saves its terrible. For me the star of the show is the dribbling.

My first FC/FIFA game and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. Started playing the mobile version which is pretty fun as well, then wanted to check out the PC version. It' EA, which I'm not a big fan of, but the game itself isn't bad. Playing with keyboard and mouse was a bit painful as it didn't seem possible to get rid of the mouse directional indicator. Plugged in my wife's Xbox One controller and the game has become a lot more enjoyable. I still prefer mouse and keyboard, but the KB/M input for this game leaves a lot to be desired.",Posted: October 10,Recommended,17.5 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This game is a not funny joke. I pre ordered EA SPORTS FC 24 to play for 10 hours before the release date, but I couldn't make it run. I thought that it's just a little problem so I uninstalled the game and installed it again but still nothing. The game didn't start the next day as well. I'm really disappointed, because I've already fallen behind in UT so much and that's 100% not my fault. In the following days I tried to repair the game using all of my IT skills (nothing worked), I asked ea support for help, but so far our 20+ messages conversation led to nothing, they were responding really fast but now it feels like they've surrendered, because I haven't got any answer for 5 days. I tried every tip from answers.ea.com threads, I watched so many youtube videos with tips, even those from the Indian guys didn't help. EA, A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY IS HIDING FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY DIDN'T SAY A WORD EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PLAYERS IS STRUGGLING WITH THIS ISSUE.

Somehow I like this better than the past couple years. It seems to play more like actual football and not be soley based on pace (still a lot of pace). Yes there are the standard bugs and control issues to work through, but they were solvable for me. Yes, it's annoying that the ladies play equal to the gents, but I'm thinking of making a virtue out of a detriment and fielding an all-girl team just for the heck of it.

EA's monopoly on soccer games is just tiresome at this point, I'll sink way too many hours into this game bc I like soccer...

Half the modes can't be played bc EA hasn't fixed issues that have plagued previous Fifa titles.

The big one being Pro Clubs or now deemed Clubs, same crap. Drop-ins don't work so if you play solo you really can't play the mode at all.

Ultimate Team is fun, it's just a great concept overall. Unfortunately users already have absolutely stacked teams this early into release because spending $70 on a game wasnt enough.",Posted: October 8,Not Recommended,266.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

For the first few hours of EA Sports FC 24, everything feels familiar gameplay-wise, for better and for worse. HyperMotion V and the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller feedback return make matches realistic, with precise ball and player physics, noticeable field wear and tear, and goal post-shaking haptics. It's hard to deny that there's a lot of attention to detail going into recreating a realistic soccer atmosphere. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence part of the Hypermotion V technology that has been so heavily advertised doesn't live up to the hype. While Kinetic Shielding makes for some exciting battles, players still fall all over each other in unnatural ways. Advanced machine learning, which is pretty much a fancy way of saying constantly improving AI, is also hit-or-miss. Your goalkeepers will sometimes stand sideways and let an easy shot in or punch a ball that could have been caught, AI teammates make terrible attacking or defensive decisions that would have Harry Maguire blushing, and you'll likely find yourself yelling about an incorrect passing input more than once a match despite knowing you angled a perfect through ball with your sticks.",Posted: October 8,Recommended,113.0 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

165 (!) packs amassed to open after the new promo for Ultimate Team. Packs of various quality (ranging from 78+ x1 to several 100k and 50k packs). The result; 1 89 rated (ofc unusable), 4x 88 rated (of which 2x Kimmich). EA hands out overpriced SBC's like it is candy, but the packweight is just utter dogsh!t. If 165 packs does't even let you to complete 2 stages of said overpriced SBC's.... They want you to buy new packs from the store. It is truly sad gaming has devolved into this cashgrab.

The best football video game on the market right now.
I love how the animation gets better every year, real gamers can tell that apart from everyone talking about this game every year it's the same game just a different update, I think this is the way to go for a football video game.
There is room for improvement in other segments such as career modes and a lot of room to enable an EDIT section for video game players.
A big minus in my opinion is that every year EA avoids putting the Serbian national team and their two clubs Crvena zvezda and Partizan Beograd into the game. What is the real reason? These two clubs are a good marketing move anyway.",Posted: October 7,Recommended,213.6 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

this game does not load, you get all kinds of error messages and nothing online fixes these error messages, so please dont waste your hard earned money on this, EA do not like us PC players, everything about this game is not compatible with PC,
anticheat error messages
clash of Virus software and the game, so it wont launch if you have virus protection on
you need Secure boot enabled, and some GPUs corrupt once CSM is disabled in the advanced BIOS menu.

Is this BETA test or full game ?

SO BUGGY AND TERRIBLE IN SO MANY WAYS

I have ALL audio in game settings OFF but I still hear the stadium background noise and it's LOUD AND ANNOYING coz I CAN'T turn it off or down unless I do that through XBox Game Bar audio

I'm trying to release one of the STAFF in ( Manager Career ) to make room for another staff but every time I try to realse the staff I get a confirmation box that's NOT WORKING AT ALL ... I can't choose yes OR no ... and I can't back out ... ONLY way to get out of it is to STOP THE GAME FROM STEAM

EAFC24: a Bug's life - same story every year. PC-STEAM gets the beta version.
- Game always opens 1:3, need to spam maximize for it to go full screen. Launch options don't fix
- Won 3 games in Draft, halfway into the final, lost connection to EA servers, up 4-1, forfeited 0-3
- Can't change custom camera angles and zoom, stuck in default settings
- No commentary - fixed now at least

Pros - Gameplay smoother
- Alisha Lehmann
Cons - Everything else
- Alisha Lehmann not up to scale

Am I still going to play? Yes

I should have listened to all the other reviews. I held out on pre-order and even after seemingly negative reviews. I bought the game because well.. it's FIFA. The game runs fine for 5 minutes then randomly stutters for a few seconds. 144 Hz down to less than 20. I've tried Ultra, Auto and lowest settings and it makes nearly no difference.

Typical EA, they could never imagine releasing an actually complete game, Game is so buggy, cant access FC shop, game lags, takes forever to start up. Just a money hungry company releasing a typical remake of last years game. EA, please for once in just try and care about your consumer and the product you provide.

Off to a poor start as usual. The game is weirdly ""heavy"". Goal keepers suck more than usual. Prem wingers are cracked. Pace doesn't work. Also passes don't work, 1/3 through balls don't go the right way/ where you aimed it. The game doesn't change players when u do a normal pass. Oh and the usual pay to win bs is thriving.",Posted: October 6,Not Recommended,9.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This game is not FUN if you play UT! DON`T buy it for that! Not even for 10 bucks its worth it.

The game is full of bugs. HyperV, destroyed animations this year. Not even cyberbug had this many visual and gameplay glitches.

The gap between players that open store packs and those that don`t is WAY TOO BIG.

You can score in this game ONLY by running down the line, pass back or by out of this world 40 yards finesse shot.

This community knows only how to abuse glitches to score.

The only things that are fun to do in UT is SBCS, trading, evolutions and when it comes to gameplay only playstyles.

Conclusion: The game is made by untalated devs and greddy publishers.",Posted: October 6,Not Recommended,171.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Not a ton of changes from the previous year, though the offline gameplay has been pretty enjoyable so far at least. Definitely a ton of bugs, including some functionalities being completely unusable as a result; such as drop in matches for clubs and being able to release coaching staff to hire better ones. I've been enjoying the actual gameplay, players feel like they have more of a weight to them and im particularly enjoying the ""advanced defending"" controls (even though im still kinda trash, especially online). These defending controls definitely feel more reasonable to control what kind of challenges you're putting in.

overall, its solid; but I dont think its worth full price. worth a shot if it goes on sale or you get a deal if you're an offline player.

The game is mostly fine, but the online modes need some serious fixing. There's been a lot of disconnects, crashes, and loading screen softlocks, especially in the Clubs game mode.

As usual, this game is riddled with bugs on PC. The exact same glitches since last year, where you can't matchmake anymore without failing 10 times, you can't play without the game freezing and then going 5x speed while everyone else scores against you.

Game is fun but also very broken. I've skipped a few years of the game and really enjoy the updates to Pro Clubs. However, the servers hardly work for Clubs. Also, the menus are annoying. There's so many menus within a menu, I have to go 4-5 menus deep to finally get to the setting or feature that I want to adjust and traversing the menus is also sluggish.",Posted: October 5,Not Recommended,103.2 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

the game is unplayable, at leats against the computer, it`s impossible to defend, same for the computer, you just have to rush and push the ball between the players.

Playing on the 10 Hour EA Play free trial.

Pros:

Some aspects of the game mechanics are much improved and performance seems better (so far, no laggy cut scenes and fewer random freezes) but at the expense of graphics. I'm not sure why the graphics quality seems so bad using the same setting as 22 and 23.

The new system for transfer is much improved and the ability to ""talk"" (not really) with an agent is a great addition to the game.

Cons:

Some bugs persist and there are some new ones. Maybe most annoyingly, if you are selected for a national team and your league and cup matches are not rescheduled, you are punished for poor performance for missing them. Since you cannot opt out of national team play, this is odd. I imagine this remains true for injuries as it did in the past, but I have not had a serious injury.

You still progress through levels too quickly. In 9 hours of play in EFL League 2, I have an 82 rated striker. Could be higher, too. The other striker on the team has a 60 rating. It creates a ridiculous gap and an unrealistic opportunity for progression through the leagues and up the league table when you can literally just run around the opposing team.

The dynamics of the game still feel like they were programmed by someone who doesn't understand the sport. Backward passes being immediately kicked back rather than being able to be used as a way to reset the midfield is still a problem, but now more than previous versions the midfield is an absolute mess. There's no apparently zone or man playing, just attacking the ball. This is annoying at first, but then it becomes too easy to beat just by passing the ball to the wings and now you have a person wide open able to run down the field while everyone moves back to their zones.

The manager's points or whatever they're called have approved in some areas (you now actually get credit for important offensive plays besides goals and assists) but you rapidly lose points for things that have nothing to do with you. Guarding your mark so they won't be open for a pass and a pass goes to someone else? Somehow, you should have known that. I think this is related to the midfield problem above where there are no proper fluid zones but rather the idea that you should simultaneously always be attacking the ball but also always in an offensive position even if you're on defense.

I think the game is worth it over 23 if you're paying full price for either. Play 23 on EA Play and wait for 24 to get there otherwise. If you're frustrated with 23, know that you will still be frustrated (and in whole new ways) with 24.",Posted: October 4,Recommended,65.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Ok here is the deal! I like how the gaming is moving towards a human like player movements. Compared to previous editions, players not feels like a rag doll anymore, i mean they kind of do but it is much better than other editions. Passing and crossing is much more fun now. Graphics is OK.

However, Career mode still sucks! No drastic changes, features a filled with BUGS! No more walkout and lineup cut scene is a deal breaker for me. Not a lot of football games out there so ima stick to it for now But honestly, no big surprises but i am disappointed AGAIN.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,50.7 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Countless bugs, especially for PC, and same old gameplay. Goalies cant hold anything, pace is the only thing that matters, and Ultimate Team is even more filled with untradeables to make it even harder to earn coins. Only buy on sale and if you want to play with friends. Pro clubs is okay.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,44.0 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Game is good but unfortunately there is so many bugs faced by many including missing commentary voices. How do you expect people to enjoy a silent game ?

Update: Requested for refund but was declined. Great job STEAM way to go for protecting the developer releasing a game full of bugs.

I actually cannot for the life of me comprehend how EA get away with releasing an unfinished 'new' version of this every single year. I used to buy FIFA yearly, mostly just to play pro clubs with friends. I held off on this since transitioning to PC, due to the lack of cross-platform on Clubs, which was a weird play from EA over the past couple of years - Anyway, they introduced it this year so my friends and I have grabbed a copy each.

Holy wow was it a bad decision, the game feels worse than it did 5 years ago. It feels like an ALPHA version of the game: the servers are horrible, it takes longer to get into a drop-in match than it does to actually play the entire length of one, the virtual pro customisation is HORRIBLE, it used to be so much more intuitive and easy to make your player look like you, or whoever you want. Ultimate team is laughable, the whole micro-transaction-pay-to-win shizz needs addressing 10 years ago, let alone now - The menus are horrible and unresponsive. The new animations pre-game are just cringe-worthy, the music played before drop-in matches is too loud for the commentary, the commentary is an insta volume 0 for me - I have seen THOUSANDS of complaints online about glitches, issues connecting to games, lag, stuttering in-game, etc.

FC24 just feels like yet another desperate attempt to take your money while papering over the cracks with unnecessary and over the top features that do not improve the gameplay in the slightest. If you're gonna get this game because you play with friends, etc., wait until it's at least half the price. Hopefully over the coming months they actually update the game enough for it to be playable.

EA and Activision need to take a page out of other game studios' books and just release ONE game and let it run for 5+ years with regular updates, so gamers are spending their hard-earned money on an optimised and pleasant gaming experience.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,57.8 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

every year EA surpasses all out expectations and release the most bug ridden game of the year. It is insane how little care the company and the devs give to this franchise that has lasted for over 20 years. They take us football fans for a joke by making us pay 70 euros for a DIGITAL TITLE. After 70 hrs of gameplay i can assure you i gave this game way more time than it deserved, new mechanics are cool and all but release a finished product and stop using us as lab rats.

After 50 more hours (i want to play with my friends and EA wont take that away from me)

HOWEVER, I am done with the glitch abusing. Conceding 6 goals from Haaland from a guy spamming R3 and bullying the defense and conceding goals out of thin air ON EVERY OCCASION plain stupid. No matter how you defend him, Double tap R1, two player press, 5 ATB... nothing works. He will just bully anyone and score (i have militao and kimpembe at CB) which is absurd. absolutely zero respect from EA. all they care about is sucking the players that sell the most jerseys, ♥♥♥♥♥.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,208.6 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Lol. Same ♥♥♥♥ just a different day. Winning 90% of my games still doesn't even feel good because of how unrewarding the gameplay is, JUST like last year. Cutbacks are just as braindead as last year, too. Gotta give the casuals a way to keep up, the AI and the horrible manual interceptions and tackles alone are not enough. Why should I get rewarded for knowing exactly what the ♥♥♥♥ my opponent is gonna do? No, my opponent needs to get rewarded for doing the same braindead ♥♥♥♥ 500 times over and over again like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bot, so that the 500th time, my AI will do some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and somehow give him an opening to capitalise on. Even though I know what's gonna happen and react to it ACTIVELY, MY AI STILL DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS. And on the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand, my opponent's AI does EVERYTHING FOR HIM ON DEFENSE. AND I MEAN EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THING. ALL HE HAS TO DO IS RUN AWAY FROM THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BALL AND HIS AI WILL TRACK BACK AND CHASE THE BALL DOWN LIKE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PRIME GATTUSO/VIEIRA.

game is absolutely washed. in higher divisons / WL, every single game is against a 5221 run down the wing cut back merchant and finesse shot plus spammers. there is legitimately NO attacking AI, hence why these strategies have formed to become the meta. i've played many years of fifa across different consoles and this is by far the worst, most unejoyable state this game has ever been in. all EA are worried about doing is selling more packs. do NOT waste your money on this game.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,142.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This game is dead to me , i literally forced 30hrs out of this dead game not enjoying a single second of this waste of space of a game they call football... £60 to £80 for a game that dont run, are you mad, never again... Dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ charging extortionate prices for games that dont run stealing peoples money... Selling unfinished products or half done products is not on....

The developers needs to be put in a line up and shot for this fraudulent farce of a release to the public. I have been playing Fifa games since 1994 and have to say this is the worse yet, and will be retiring from playing any EA products in the future.

I want a full refund for this dead game that needs to be burned, buried and gutted. ♥♥♥♥ EA for wasting my time and stealing my money.... Extortionate Joke Industry.

Any developer that puts out junk with there force advertisement of any product that dont work or run properly after releasing to the public should be fined and charged for extorting money from customers period.

EA are a bunch of frauds... We need to put a stop to EA Games for extorting consumers and leading us on to purchase their products. This multi million company is taking the piss out of all consumers with the crap they releasing on extorting prices and has no intention of fixing the real problems, instead releasing patches that has nothing to do with the underlining issues with the game.",Posted: October 4,Not Recommended,84.0 hrs on record,2 people found this review helpful 0

Fix all the bugs that have existed since as far back as I can remember in career mode. Can’t sack coaches is a new one. Game just freezes. Still empty markers where obviously some text should be.

Also bring back the players coming out and lining up with the team sheets being read out, what an idiotic thing to remove.

When EA Sports and FIFA parted ways, I thought EA is planning an extraordinary release to make their statement of their new identity EA FC 24. My $70 is well wasted - thanks to EA's embarrassing new UI & UX, buggy game play and career mode. It started with a high expectation but ended up as a huge disappointment.

Switched over to pc and this is the first time buying fifa in steam coming from xbox. This is honestly the worst experience ive ever had after buying the ultimate edition. The first couple of days I couldnt even get into the game and had to get the EA Pro just to play a game i paid 100 dollars to play and was on a 10 hour trail. Then the game freezes all the time in UT. I currently cant even run the game until i do a fresh restart on the pc. I press play and the ea app opens then closes then nothing happens. Every year I play less and less. Last year I lasted until November. This year looks like October at best.

Like every single year EA once again causes me many anger issues with their typical scripting and bs ""realistic"" game mechanics. Of course we cannot forget the pay to win and gambling mechanics designed for children. This game is the reason why there is so much hate in the world, this game is my 8th reason, this game helps me keep the same hate for EA that I've had for them since Fifa 14, this game is why families lose their homes due to children spending their parents' life savings on the same idiotic game, this game is the reason for all the wars happening around the world, this game is just perfect if you want to be mentally unstable for the rest of your life.",Posted: October 3,Not Recommended,284.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I can't believe I got suckered into buying another EA game. I thought after losing the rights to the ""FIFA"" title they would step up and put out a respectable game, but once again its basically a copy-paste of the last several editions with minor updates and still so many things broken. Career mode has always been my favorite way to play, but it is pathetic and hasn't received any real attention in years. Dynamic potential is beyond broken for the 4th straight year and has never been fixed. This company cares about nothing but money and this game is a clear reflection of a company that does not care about the product that they put out.",Posted: October 3,Not Recommended,174.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Dude, its just crazy. EA manages each year to release both the best and worst football simulation.

If you look at the game from a base point, its great. Lots of content, good graphics, fun gameplay, licences... There is lots to be loved and if you are a casual how just wants to play a few games with friends its cool.

But holy ♥♥♥♥. Skipped the last two years and still, there is almost nothing new or exciting. Sure some new cutscenes and changed graphics, but other than that? only minimal improvments, if you can call them that at all.

And the bugs! Oh my god the bugs... Clipping, wrong graphics, no graphics, misplaces grapgics, wrong-scaled interfaces. input-lag, worng input-read, no input-read, players disappering, kits not showing, misspelling. The list just keeps going on and on.

A Francise as big as EAFC (FIFA) should at least be putting some of their billions into game design and game fixing. EAFC is one of the few games that everybody plays and if you ask, nobody will tell you they actually enjoyed playing it.

Its great value for money, but holy ♥♥♥♥ the game is broken.",Posted: October 3,Not Recommended,28.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

It's my first time buying a FIFA (now FC) at launch since 2015, and I have to say that the game has improved a lot in terms of gameplay if more competitive style games are your thing, tho this is mostly talking about Ultimate Team, in other aspects the game feels the same or even worse, just minor upgrades in some areas, and completely abandoned in others. I would recommend it if you are itching for a football gacha.

Ultimate Team is more fun than ever I would say, all the new gamemodes and ways to get players without having to spend money feel good in contrast with FIFA 2013 or 2015. Building your club is a nice experience, and the learning curve for the gameplay itself is interesting, has a lot of skillcap and feels rewarding.

Other gamemodes which are fun don't have that many players in them, and feel like they could really use an upgrade in terms of progress and showing off cool stuff that you can achieve, they feel dated and incomplete stuck in 2013.",Posted: October 3,Recommended,184.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

This game is typical of any EA backed game. Absolutely terrible at launch, copy and paste from last years game and 80% of the features don't even work. I find the new features to be a needed addition to the slow and monotonous ultimate team gameplay. Clubs, the most exciting and communal part of the entire electronic soccer/football space, literally does not work. If you were here to play with friends, DO NOT LET THE MARKETING FOOL YOU!!! YOU CANNOT CONNECT CROSS-PLAT!!! sure the game may have the infrastructure for cross platform play but not a single feature works for it, so, understand this was simply an advertising scheme. All new features become stale after roughly 43hrs of play and the game feels utterly soulless. If I can save just one person's money, please DO NOT PURCHASE.

Would really appreciate a refund or, better yet, 15% down on their stock overnight would work too.",Posted: October 3,Not Recommended,124.0 hrs on record,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

So it's a copy and paste game, but worse. On legendary you literally cant defend against AI. They cant be tackled, every shot is on target, and every rebound goes to an AI player. The graphics are some how worse, the cut scenes are blurry. Like, what the hell is going on? On one of the deep dive videos it says you can create a stadium on career, but yet its only on UT, which is trash. I love the sport, i love Borussia Dortmund. And it sucks that this is the only game i play to even feel closer to the real game. EA you need to step your game up, and big time. Make a lot of changes, add more stuff to career. This game can have it all, but ya'll choose not to do anything about it. You care about UT cause it brings in quick cash thats it.

Ok lets be serious, the mechanics of the game are not to bad, but fixes needed are the crossing is too OP, the tackling is weak, in many games having to tackle 6x and they still come out with the ball.

Graphically, it gives yellow cards on a red card challenge even when they do get sent off, the photographer isn't holding the camera, there are floating clip boards at half time like sort your game out. at this starndard it's pretty poor",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,145.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

When I play online, I play against not only another person,
I play against terrible gameplay with annoying delay before each gamepad operation.
I play against inaccurate passes which don't match with my stick direction.
I play against broken interceptions when your defender already get the ball but it go to opponent by some magical consequences.
I play against 71 deep + pressing tactic which actually broken and you cannot do anything except of ball losing.
I play against broken R1 dribbling which allow average players dribble like Ronaldinho in prime time.
I play against Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in match, when goalkeeper of your opponent can save every dead ball, but yours can't save anything.
I play against opponent AI bots in defending, which often defend better than opponent and do some unbelievable tackles without opponent actions.
I play against slow players with pace 60 who can easy run faster than Al Owairan with max pace stats.
I play against my stupid goalkeeper who cannot save ball which fly right in his body. Even if I move him by right stick and match with shooting direction, animation of my goalkeeper broken and don't match with reality.
I play against broken physics, when VVD can be pushed by player which is totally less than him in one and a half time.
I play against kick off glitches when you understand that opponent will score because of strange behaviour of my players.

If you want to buy this game to play online you should understand that you won't be able to control major part of actions in matches. In lots of cases it's not a game about ""if you click buttons better than opponent you win"", it's a game about scripts, handicap (DDA), glitches, bad connections and broken behaviour of players.

EA don't want to fix this issues by years, because community don't have another football game.
EA just want to sell you new 100 rare players pack for 50 dollars.

THE WORST EA GAME EVER!
This game is such a garbage. The gameplay is unbelievably bad. Goalkeepers cannot do anything in the goal. Any free kick, finesse shot or outside foot shot is 100% a goal. Don't try to do anything to stop that, especially if the player has the gold playstyle.
The defence is funny, no tackles, no interceptions, make the AI plays for you.
As well, there are too many rebounds.
EA only develops in graphics, which does not benefit players in the game, and forgets the main thing ""gameplay""

Do not spend £89 on this trash game, until EA fixes every single bug they imported from FIFA23. I swear you will miss your life and friends and get nervous and anxious.",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,162.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

I hate this game. it is most definitely the worst experience u can have playing a simulation. I actively get enraged whenever I play. 30 hours in of pure terror and I am uninstalling due to the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that occurs within a single 12 minute match of football. please don't buy this game you will regret it massively, trust me. they bring the same game out each year and all they change is the way the menu looks instead of fixing the genuine problems in the game.

♥♥♥♥ game.

I've played a further 30 hours since my last review and i still believe this is the worst game to exist. Please I'm begging you don't waste money on this game. This addictive game has me scraping my skin off whilst sat in a dark room rocking back and forth in absolute terror of what this game beholds. I hate it so much I can't stress it enough.",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,60.4 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

A game full of bugs and problems. Bad menus, wrong changes in the game. In the Ultimate section, there is no key to claim all completed objectives. And the completed objectives are not clear in which section they are and you have to find them one by one. Sometimes the red bubble of the new objective notice does not appear. On the computer system with the highest power, you have to completely reduce the graphics of the game, but you will still experience lag.

EA Drops the Ball Again!

Ugh, FC24 is here, and it's a letdown - big time. First off, the microtransactions are just too much. So, what could have been a tribute to soccer ends up feeling more like a costly slot machine where spending money is key to getting a competitive squad. Honestly, it probably shouldn’t even be legal.

And where’s the new stuff? The game works, sure. But it's the same-old, same-old, year after year. We’ve been yelling about this forever, but EA's just not listening.

We really need EA to take a break, skip a year, and give us something awesome and NEW next time. How about diving into a footballer’s life with a cool, open-world feature (think GTA vibes)? That would let us really get into our football fantasies and feel fresh and fun.

In short, EA, it's time to step up. No more grabbing our cash and handing us the same thing every year. We want to see something big and new – and we're waiting!",Posted: October 2,Not Recommended,222.3 hrs on record,"No one has rated this review as helpful yet

an honest review from a decent player, this fifa or she fc as others want to call it is one of the best soccer games ever released by her, all the negative comments are mostly left by players of maximum div 8 9 , a fairly experienced player can tell you that the game is brilliant, the passes are responsive, the players feel very realistic and unique and some say that the players feel slow which is very false, if we were playing ultimate team it is absolutely normal to play with weaker cards because it's the beginning of the game, you can't expect on the first day with a gold team to play like a futties. You have several versatile cards that can be evolved which makes the game brilliant at the beginning. And for those who they complain about women is very simple, don't play with them in the team, you are not obliged, and if you get beaten try to play better, definitely don't get beaten because the opponent has women in the team. the game as a whole is among the most good fifas released in recent years, whoever doesn't recognize this most likely can't get out of division 7 6",Posted: October 2,Recommended,112.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Don't even bother. For most people the game won't even start. EA, a billion dollar company, have screwed up yet another launch. F1 22, FIFA 23 and now FC 24.

They say they're working on a fix, but let's be honest, this is the kind of thing you'd expect from an indie developer.

There was me thinking it was industry standard to at least check the game works before you release to the general public?

Playstyles are interesting, sprint dribbling is great, female players add a new dimension.

But... the qa/qc on this game is the worst I have ever experienced in a EA game (which is saying something).

Players are glitching (Hegerberg), objectives are broken, the companion app on multiple platforms crashes on button presses.

It would be bad if it was just a single purchase, but EA has created a market in FUT. Having software that is this bad, with the amount of money flowing through it, is unforgivable.

This is the game that ended for me.",Posted: October 1,Not Recommended,108.6 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

After playing, I can say that the game isn't GREAT. BUT, the game is really fun and really well made. The goalies work fine I have had zero issues with them. I have played 4 online matches with no issues. The FUT is still fun and they have so many different cool things to unlock for your team. Overall, I would recommend getting this game on sale.

Unless they fix all the current bugs in this game, don't waste your money on it.
endless crashes, 1 second input delay, menus freezing etc.

even if they fix all those bugs, don't buy it unless you see they actually add content into the game and not some cards that no one could really get because the packs give you ♥♥♥♥ so youll have to buy coins to do some real progress in this game.

Мав велике бажання знову пограти у фіфу, але ця гра наразі повне розчарування. Довелося повернути.

Перше знайомство з грою почалося із вильоту при її загрузці. Після гугління допомогло запуск в оффлайн режимі. Проте гра все ще корешала при будь-якій спробі підключитись до сервера.

Щодо геймплею, то від не сильно змінився і з тим що я бачив грав років. З новенько тут постійні підлагування.

I'm not a massive footy fan but fancied playing something different, usually play driving sims and shoot em ups .

Decided to opt for the EA Play for 10 hours option as sixty odd quid wouldn't be money well spent for me.

I have a fairly high end machine to play this on, RTX 4070 , 32gb DDR400 ram and a core i5 9600 cpu .

The game runs maxed out at 4k and 120hz ( LG 55in oled tv with 120hz refresh rate screen ) and not had any issues as suggested in the reviews.

It has some problems, but overall I am enjoying it much more than 23. The new features and animations they added were pretty nice and noticeable. Now would I recommend it? I honestly can't say, It's still the same feeling as older FIFAS. It's to be expected not much you can do with sports games other than add new features, animations, players, ETC. If you enjoy play Clubs (A.K.A Pro clubs) then I would honestly recommend it for Clubs.

It's clunky with many game breaking bugs. I only play career mode, but the number of times I've had to shut down the game because some options are bugged is too high.

The real letdown is that many of these game-breaking bugs were known (i.e., posted on EA forum) during 'early access' before official launch, but there was no remediation upon actual launch. There is an apparent lack of commitment to making a good game and a lack of commitment to fixing prevailing issues ASAP.",Posted: October 1,Not Recommended,24.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Game requires you to have EA app to coordinate friends - and even when you can see the friends in the game menu, it then won't recognise friends to play online.

the day 1 failures that should have been recognized early on is terrible. The gameplay itself is refreshing but that might be because I haven't paid for this game in 3 years. 6/10

**5 days later and there are more bugs than I have ever seen. Every ball a goalkeeper saves has the most unrealistic outcome, clubs is a disaster they really dont give a damn about it. Played a seasons match where neither myself or my opponent could control our teams.",Posted: October 1,Not Recommended,177.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Unless you want to spend money to buy packs, good luck with ultimate team. Completely over-run with god squads already. Pro-clubs (the reason i bought it) is very intermittent with working, seems to be able to get one game out and then it Sh*ts itself to play more... A bug loads of players are getting saying it cannot connect to the game server/ no opponents found. Overpriced and under-performing game. You'd think since this is the first game away from ""FIFA"" they would have put in more effort to a successful launch",Posted: October 1,Not Recommended,45.9 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

Year after year, EA, despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of all-time, you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price. People are paying a premium for your games every year, and are met with some of the most lacklustre, mundane and boring features every year. Sure, you can blame us for continuing to buy the game, but the truth is, I love football. You love football. And FIFA/EA Sports FC is the only game out there that can scratch that itch. There are no viable competitors. Therefore, through our love for the beautiful game that is football, we keep buying it. And you know that, EA. That is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new features/improve the game.

You are too busy milking all the 12-year old FUTwhales that spend mum and dad's money on your stupid packs, which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end. You do not care that Career Mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of Jesus Christ, or that Pro Clubs has so much untapped potential. All that matters to you, is FUT, and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year, only for all of their players, items, to be obsolete the following iteration of FIFA/EAFC.

I would also like to point out that, despite us paying the same amount, the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us PC players is unforgivable. Not just this year, but every other year. Do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was FIFA 21, FIFA 22 and FIFA 23. If you are lucky enough to even launch the game, you are most likely met with terrible FPS, choppy animations, bugged out player models, and honestly, the list is endless if I wanted it to be. Speaking of lists, I am going to provide one with all of the bugs that I encountered in my first few hours of game-play.

→ Choppy animations, frames drop and becomes an eye-sore to watch.
→ Commentary does not work on launch. There is 0 commentary.
→ Player models, the hair, bugs out when it is rainy and foggy. Becomes pixelated.
→ Can not connect to the internet (whatever this means).
→ Controllers not working properly.
→ Game keeps minimising on PC.
→ The game is not opening and launching for so many players.
→ Can not sack coaches in Career Mode, it just freezes.
→ Objectives not counting.
→ Not getting XP when completing objectives.
→ The game freezes on the EA FC logo.
→ Stuck in half-time animation.
→ Game-play stutter.
→ Overall TERRIBLE performance even on high-end hardware.
→ Anti-cheat error message.
→ Media questions still make 0 sense.
→ Same animations for media interviews and transfers.
→ Same animations for injuries, etc. 0 innovation and creativity here.
→ Menu in FUT will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again.
→ If you navigate the menu too quickly, it messes up and goes all over your screen.

Again, like mentioned, this list could be as long as you want it to be. The point is, you are incompetent EA, and you are ESPECIALLY incompetent when it comes to creating a proper PC port. But of course, because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives, you can keep getting away with this. I am an idiot for playing this game and ""enabling it"" and I know I am, but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run.

Also, why on Earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game? What went on in your heads over there at EA when you thought, hmm, let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go. What about Champions League nights, important finals, etc? There is no immersion anymore. You do not get to watch your team walk out, line up, with the anthem roaring in the background, your players lined up and ready to battle it out... it just sends you straight into action. This is SO stupid. As a Career Mode enjoyer (shock, I know right, cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode?) this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games, especially big ones. Mind-boggling decision. Begs the question, in typical EA fashion, what iteration of EA FC will you bring this back and market it as a ""brand new, immersive feature""?",Posted: October 1,Not Recommended,16.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Typical EA FIFA garbage. If I were a professional player in the game I'd be insulted at the fact that I cant make a 2 yard pass and instead my player passes like a tard straight to the other team for no reason other than the fact that the neckbeard code monkey at EA doesnt know how to do their job. Passes don't go where you point to most of the time. The game wants someone to win so it adjusts in your opponents favour seemingly every time and allows them to score after you've had 20 shots and no goal. You might as well not have a through ball option because it hardly works, unless you are trying to give the ball away. Women are higher rated and do more damage than actual professional players on ultimate team. The only thing worth playing is career mode maybe if you just want something casual but as usual the online component was programmed by a bunch of useless turds.

Hey guys, so in the past few days I had big stutters on the start of cutscenes (FK, PEN, Corner, Goal celebration, etc.). What seemed to fix the issue is putting Rendering quality, grass quality to medium and crows quality to low and No Limit FPS. It reduced the stuttering heavily, still not perfect but much better. Only downside is that we can't fully enjoy the good graphics since I assume its the Render issue if you put it above medium but it is what it is.",Posted: September 30,Not Recommended,117.1 hrs on record,1 person found this review helpful 0

The Core Gameplay of the game is basically same as fifa 22,23 with getting stupid goals and scripted events,especially in career mode which i like and did get some improvements over the previous entry.However i find the gameplay much mode enjoyable when messing with the cpu and player sliders making the game more realistic and there being less goals more games ending 1-0,1-1,2-1 etc.. which really adds to the realism when playing career mode. Overall as a career mode only player i quite like the game when altering the sliders tho the core is the same as the previous titles.",Posted: September 30,Recommended,47.2 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

For gameplay, the game does feel a little more different and slower paced than previous FIFA titles. For starters, you actually have to aim directly at a player for a pass to complete (except for through ball) and aim precisely at the goal to score. Any off positioning can cost you a loss of possession or missing the entire goal. There are new goalkeeper mechanics that I have noticed help more than hurt, especially 1 on 1s. Overall, my initial rating for the gameplay is an 8/10.

As far as user experience, I just don't like the UI. It literally looks like a preset lower budget interface. Holding down your left trigger in ultimate team to scroll to what you want is just over-complicated compared to FIFA 23 where you had everything on one page. Also, I shouldn't lose a contract on my starting 11 when my opponent in UT quits the game on kickoff. I just could never understand why, especially if the game recognizes who it was that quit. Overall, I rate the user experience a 5/10. It's not the worst but can definitely be worked on.",Posted: September 30,Recommended,10.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

After 100+ hrs my suggestion is to pass on buying or wait for a deep sale. The problem is the game-play. It's like someone who doesn't understand the sport coded it. I guess that's the problem... if you love the sport... the game is very frustrating. The visuals are good to great... if you like fut game mode... the content is very hit and miss depending on the week (I did it for a bit). I've played the FIFA series for more than 10 years. For me the game play (i.e. trying to score and defend) is most important... and it's not good in this game. Tons of videos for FUT and career mode of ppl complaining and all the issues so won't repeat here. I started playing old career modes of past titles for now. Hope they fix this game... there is the potential for a good game here. For now... negative review.",Posted: September 30,Not Recommended,191.7 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

It's FIFA 23 with new lighting. Don't bother.

I was initially excited for this, and I don't know why, really. FIFA 23 for the last couple months was buggy to the point of being unplayable, not to mention the game would randomly crash during every match. I was hoping that some of the bugs and text mistakes and gameplay issues that have been in the game since FIFA 20 would have been resolved, but no. ALL of the bugs from the last 4 FIFA games are back. At least it hasn't crashed on me mid-match (yet).

Unlike the last 4 games, this one doesn't run as well for some reason. I have a 13900k, 4080, 64 GB of RAM and have the game installed on a SSD. FIFA 23 ran at a smooth 120 FPS in game with all the settings cranked. EAFC 24 runs at a choppy 80-90. It's not unplayable, but the graphics are the same, the cutscenes are the same, the player models are the same aside from the presentation and some better shadows the game looks the same as last year, so I don't really understand why it doesn't run as well. The really confusing thing is that when I'm looking at GPU usage it's only at about 70% and CPU is at 2 or 3%, so my hardware isn't really being taxed and the game's performance is worse... for some reason.

My time so far has been spent in Manager Career mode, so my experience with the game is limited to that, ATM. I will update after I've played the game a bit more. TL;DR will be at the bottom. As for the game itself:

Cutscenes are recycled from FIFA 23, which is unwelcome, as they were a massive annoyance to me from the previous game. I swear to god if I have to watch EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NEW SIGNING doing that stupid treadmill run I'm going to lose my damn mind. And why do I have to watch as my 3rd string youth-level GK leaves the club lobby depressingly as he goes out on loan? I don't care, that's why he's leaving. I don't need a sad little cutscene to tell me he's leaving. Just have him leave. If it were a player that's been a regular starter with the club for a couple years, fine, but it isn't. The one cutscene I wish they'd kept is the walkout of the tunnel before a match where they go over the lineups for each team. That's gone. You still get to choose your walkout anthem for your club in the customization menu, which is strange seeing as how the instance where that's used doesn't seem to be in the game anymore, so what's the point? Yellow card/red card cutscenes are exactly the same animations but filmed from the point of view of the referee... which doesn't look good. I've had a couple instances where the ref's hair clips through the camera. It's also got a fisheye effect on it, like it's supposed to be a bodycam or something. Idk, it just doesn't look good.

So as far as manager customization goes, they've added some boring-looking shorts, some more boring-looking shirts, hoodies, and 4 pairs of glasses. That's. About. It. I know there's more customization options in Volta for your player, including tattoos and more facial hair options (I will gladly take an comically-sized handlebar mustache) so why doesn't that transfer into the manager creator? Oh, yeah, Volta customization can be monetized and EA are money grubbers. Good news, though, EA, (and I can't believe I'm suggesting this) make the options for character customization in Volta available in Career mode and monetize them like you would in Volta or FUT. Players get better customization (albeit at a cost) and you potentially get more money. Everyone sort-of gets what they want, or at least it's consistent with the rest of the game. Kits are largely the same, some new selections, but not many. One kit option shows up twice for some reason. There are also KITS WITH SPONSORS WOOOOOOO!!! What sponsors are they? EAFC, Frostbite, Truemotion, and one other EAFC-centric one I can't be bothered to remember. There is one kit for each of them and that's it. Also, while I'm ranting: Why can't I have a color slider or color wheel for choosing my kit and badge colors? I get to choose from 10 colors for badges and 30ish(? I'm not counting them) colors for my kit. What's so hard about a color mixer option? The colors for badges don't mix with the colors for kits unless I choose basic colors, which just looks like every other club in the game. It's so lazy. I'm grateful that I can choose to customize a custom team, but there's better means of customization in other EA games. Dragon Age Inquisition is in Frostbite and uses a color mixer, so don't tell me it's not possible with the hundreds of people that work on this game every year. And how do they still not have icons for some of the hairstyles? A couple of them are literally just regen character heads with the hair on them, and one of them isn't even the correct hair. One of the icons just shows a bald head and when you select it it puts a hat on your manager. How the hell did this make it past QA? Is there even QA at this point? Probably not.

The gameplay this year is probably the only improvement I've noted besides the lighting model (I'll get to that later). Players collide with each other in more realistic ways, They seem to have fixed players with explosive running trait actually running like a drunk slug, and the gameplay feels arcadey but not like pinball. Another addition is that when simming a match, instead of watching dots slide around on a JPEG of a pitch you can watch the game from the sideline like a manager would and make changes from the sideline.

As I mentioned before, bugs from the last 4 games and beyond are still here. Missing text, placeholder textures, flickering shadows in the background of some cutscenes, all this on top of the usual shenanigans you get during a match. In my first match alone I had a player fly 20 feet into the air after a tackle, watched another player run into and get stuck in the ad boards behind the goal, and the player who scored a hat trick went to get the match ball from the refs and the ball hovered in the air while the player walked away pretending to hold the ball. It's a mess. I don't understand how some of these bugs have been part of this game for several years and they never get fixed. It's downright ridiculous and shameful at this point.


I like the improvement to the match day gameplay and graphics, but everything else about this game is either a step back or the exact same as the last few FIFA's. Most of my time with FIFA games is spent in the menus between matches managing players and formations, scouting new players, so on and so forth and the updated UI just isn't good. It looks pretty, but it's less functional than previous entries. The bugs are just as bad as they've ever been and likely to get worse because EA is notoriously bad at fixing their games. They've removed things from the game that actively make it better and the things they leave in don't work properly. It's all a proper mess. And the fact they have the nerve to charge $70 for this garbage is just infuriating. Especially when I know the modes that have the predatory micro-transactions have better options to them.

I've already gone past the 2 hour return threshold so I can't get my money back at this point, otherwise I would be returning this game. The only thing left to do it to put hundreds of hours into this game and hope it gets better with time. That being said, there's not a lot of better options. eFootball is in the same boat, but with fewer licensed teams (also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and Football Manager is little more than a spreadsheet simulator with more depth.

Absolute buggy mess as always.
No attention paid to single player again.
Predatory gambling aimed at children.
If you start the game with keyboard, there is no way to change to controller, you have to quit the game and take the loss.
buggy UI
Crashes to desktop
Pace is king again, - The only way to win is to have the fastest players.. cause that's how football works.. right.. Doesn't matter what overall they are, could be a 50 rated player from 4th tier of football, as long as they have 95 pace they're GOATed.
Goalkeepers randomly fall over.
SCRIPTING IS WORSE THAN EVER. WHATEVER YOU DO NEVER GO 2 GOALS UP. - YOU WILL LOSE 3-2 IT'S ALREADY BEEN DECIDED BY A POWER GREATER THAN OURS (ea).
Players will play like they're stuck in the mud if you're playing a promotion game, that way they can make it harder to let you move up the divisions and thus make you feel like you need to GAMBLE more.
Everything in this game pushes you towards their 'loot boxes' or we might was well call it what it is, the 'EA CEO retirement fund' cause that money clearly isn't being put back into the development of the game.

So i bought ea fc today the 29 of september an at first i was not able to play ultimate team bc of the servers. Later this day after waiting for 4h i finally got in and then it stuck me, where is my 4600 points? I spent 100 euros on this game and i havent even gotten my 4600 points yet. Thank you EA sports!",Posted: September 29,Not Recommended,100.1 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0

Totally loving the game with just initial lag issue, for it to remove I play the game one level down of resolution for the first half and then change it back to highest , after which no lag is experienced. Overall fun to play,",Posted: September 29,Recommended,47.9 hrs on record,No one has rated this review as helpful yet 0
